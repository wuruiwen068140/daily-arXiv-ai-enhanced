While the\nmajority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and\nfake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family\nof generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative\nclasses and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of\nlarge pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.\nEffectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures\ninformation discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we\ndemonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve\nstate-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining\ncomputationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot\nsettings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,\nachieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u5047\u5185\u5bb9\u5224\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5047\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u533a\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
