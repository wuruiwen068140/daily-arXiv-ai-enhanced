### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResPA是一种新的对抗攻击方法，通过残差梯度引导对抗样本向损失函数的平坦区域移动，显著提高了迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致对抗样本的迁移性受限。

Method: 利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，结合历史梯度的参考方向，优化对抗样本的生成。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA在迁移性上优于现有方法，且与输入变换方法结合后效果更佳。

Conclusion: ResPA通过全局扰动方向优化，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型的泛化能力，解决了现有方法在开放世界中泛化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因数据有限导致泛化能力不足，性能在不同场景下不一致。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型通用知识，并提出知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制自适应调整通用知识指导。

Result: 实验证明该方法在真实OOD基准上表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GS平衡和KDE机制显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide提出了一种动态推理机制UnGuidance，通过调整引导尺度实现精确控制，选择性遗忘特定概念，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型可能被滥用生成有害内容，需要有效的方法在不影响整体性能的情况下移除特定知识。

Method: 结合LoRA和Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG），通过动态调整引导尺度实现选择性遗忘。

Result: UnGuide在概念移除任务中优于现有方法，同时保持了图像的真实性和模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide提供了一种高效且可控的遗忘机制，解决了LoRA在遗忘过程中可能影响无关内容的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，能够精确地将风格特征应用于感兴趣区域，并通过内部混合技术改善区域选择不完美的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对整个图像进行风格迁移，而用户可能仅需对特定区域应用风格。传统掩码方法无法准确捕捉感兴趣区域的风格特征。

Method: 采用部分卷积的风格迁移网络，结合网络内部混合技术，以处理区域选择不完美的情况。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉和定量上均优于传统掩码方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了局部风格迁移中的问题，提升了风格迁移的准确性和视觉效果。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中存在泛化性差、推理速度慢和条件对齐弱的问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，并提出区域特异性对比损失增强条件敏感性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在加速和条件一致性上取得显著改进，适用于数据增强等下游任务。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本学习框架，适用于多种脑成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺的问题，提升预训练模型在少样本条件下的适用性。

Method: 采用Masked Autoencoder (MAE)预训练策略，结合轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet。

Result: 在分类和分割任务中均取得最优性能，尤其在数据有限条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适用于低资源临床环境和神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成图结构并插值实现快速风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条或特征提取网络，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: 生成样条隐式表面的图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 实现了快速风格迁移（2分钟内），支持任意风格图像和样条。

Conclusion: 该方法高效灵活，适用于消费级硬件，代码已开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，通过处理多缩放图像集，显著提升了工业检测中的细节捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节，且多缩放图像会破坏多视角一致性。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放标量，并采用新的姿态策略，先解决广角图像，再通过缩放一致的裁剪匹配处理缩放图像。

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著提升了PSNR、SSIM，并降低了LPIPS。

Conclusion: MZEN扩展了NeRF在工业检测中的应用，同时保持了全局精度和微米级细节捕捉能力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割和跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余阻碍了基础模型（如SAM2）的有效学习。

Method: 采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，优化对象运动和内存管理。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的平均Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中展现出高效、鲁棒的分割潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

### [10] [Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851)
*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用时间一致性优化视频分割中的令牌聚类，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有令牌减少方法无法有效利用时间冗余。

Method: TCA通过时间相关性优化令牌聚类，保留细节同时减少计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA提升了现有方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现出色，是一种高效优化方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

### [11] [VISTA: Vision-Language Imitation of Situational Thinking and Attention for Human-Like Driver Focus in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05852)
*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的方法，通过自然语言预测驾驶员的视觉注意力变化，并在少样本和零样本学习下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像中的注意力分配，而忽略了动态变化的注意力景观。本文旨在通过自然语言建模驾驶员的视线变化。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人类反馈优化，并微调LLaVA模型，结合低层线索和上下文信息（如路线语义、风险预测）。

Result: 微调后的模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，并引入了领域特定的语义对齐和响应多样性指标。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试用自然语言生成驾驶员视觉注意力分配和转移预测，为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [12] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多视角相机进行视线目标估计（GTE）的方法，通过整合不同视角的信息提高准确性和适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角方法存在面部遮挡、目标模糊和视线外目标等局限性，多视角方法可以解决这些问题。

Method: 方法包括头部信息聚合（HIA）模块、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）模块和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块。

Result: 在多视角数据集上显著优于单视角基线方法，尤其在第二视角提供清晰面部视图时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了GTE任务的性能，还扩展了单视角无法实现的功能，如仅通过第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新和自适应集成模块提升CLIP模型在分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有缓存方法仅存储高置信度样本，限制了决策边界。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块动态整合所有测试样本，并采用自适应集成模块减少对提示的依赖，结合两者优势提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为测试时适应提供了高效且有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个先进的视觉语言引导框架，用于生成3D场景并支持基于人类反馈的交互式编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景设计依赖大量人工，现有自动化方法难以生成开放域场景或支持灵活编辑，因此需要直接从文本生成3D世界。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）识别和解析场景中的对象，通过先进的3D生成模型生成高质量资产，并应用空间约束实现语义一致和物理合理的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0能生成多样且风格丰富的3D场景，在人类评估和CLIP评估中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在3D场景生成和编辑方面表现出色，适用于游戏建模等实际应用。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

*Lang Nie,Yuan Mei,Kang Liao,Yunqiu Xu,Chunyu Lin,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RopStitch是一种无监督的深度图像拼接框架，具有鲁棒性和自然性，通过双分支架构和虚拟最优平面概念实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拼接中内容对齐与结构保留的矛盾，并提高模型在多样化场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用双分支架构分别捕获粗粒度与细粒度特征，并通过虚拟最优平面概念优化拼接过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在场景鲁棒性和内容自然性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: RopStitch通过创新的架构和优化策略，实现了高效且自然的图像拼接。

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Conclusion: 研究推动了建筑监测技术向更自动化和精确化的方向发展。

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化和几何误差传播，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

TL;DR: Bifrost-1是一个统一框架，通过将预训练的多模态LLM与扩散模型结合，利用CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，实现高效训练和高保真图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整合LLM和扩散模型时面临高成本训练问题，因为LLM在预训练中未接触图像表示。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，通过轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并保留MLLM的多模态推理能力。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了预训练MLLM和扩散模型，实现了高效可控的图像生成。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

TL;DR: PASG框架通过几何特征聚合和视觉语言模型动态耦合几何基元与功能可供性，解决了机器人操作中语义与几何特征的割裂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中高层任务语义与低层几何特征之间的割裂问题限制了视觉语言模型的应用，需要一种自动化的语义接地方法。

Method: 提出PASG框架，包括自动基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定和空间语义推理基准。

Result: PASG在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注。

Conclusion: PASG实现了对物体更细粒度的语义-可供性理解，为机器人操作中的几何基元与任务语义提供了统一范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 将重建的3D场景与4D人体动画无缝集成存在位置、光照和相机轨迹的挑战。

Method: 设计精确放置模块、无训练风格对齐方法及联合后重建方法。

Result: 生成具有高几何细节和时空一致性的动态场景视频。

Conclusion: AnimateScene有效解决了集成问题，并支持多样化相机和动作组合。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于能量的测试时适应方法（ETA），用于调整预训练的深度补全模型以适应新环境数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度补全模型在从源数据转移到目标数据时，由于协变量偏移，预测结果可能不准确。现有方法缺乏对目标数据的先验知识，因此需要一种无需假设目标分布的方法。

Method: 通过对抗性扰动探索数据空间，训练能量模型以评估深度预测的局部区域是否属于源数据分布。在测试时更新模型参数以最小化能量，使预测与源分布对齐。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均比现有最优方法提高了6.94%（室外）和10.23%（室内）。

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型和测试时参数更新，有效解决了深度补全模型在新环境中的适应问题，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中实现显著加速，性能损失轻微。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态情感识别任务中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有方法在化妆细节和身份保持上表现不佳，主要由于缺乏结构化配对数据。

Method: 提出了MakeupQuad数据集和EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏迭代提升数据与模型质量。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保持上取得了平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Conclusion: Spectrum通过结合扩散模型和细粒度解析，显著提升了人体和衣物分割的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Conclusion: InstantEdit通过创新的技术组合，实现了快速、高质量的图像编辑，为文本引导编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Motivation: 解决半监督学习中的情感识别问题，通过整合多种模态和利用未标记数据提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

*Huanyu Wang,Jushi Kai,Haoli Bai,Lu Hou,Bo Jiang,Ziwei He,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，显著降低计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中大量视觉标记增加了上下文长度，导致高计算开销和推理延迟。

Method: 利用视觉特征在低频分量集中的特性，通过二维离散余弦变换（DCT）应用低通滤波器压缩视觉表示。

Result: 在多个图像基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上表现突出，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自回归图像生成的Next Editing-token Prediction（NEP）方法，仅重新生成需要编辑的区域，避免了对非编辑区域的不必要修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且编辑质量受限。

Method: 通过预训练任意顺序自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，实现零样本图像编辑，并适应NEP方法。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新最优性能，支持零样本测试时缩放（TTS）。

Conclusion: NEP方法显著提升了图像编辑的效率和质量，支持灵活的区域编辑和迭代优化。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法提供直观、即时的性能差异反馈，BioMotion Arena填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用成对比较评估，收集45k+投票，分析53个主流LLMs和MLLMs在90种生物运动变体上的表现。

Result: 90%以上模型（包括前沿开源和专有模型）无法生成基本人形点光源组或流畅生物运动。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准，无需依赖真实数据。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用大型多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型的泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在泛化性和可解释性上表现不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（钟形回归、成对排序和时间一致性）来模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在域内和OOD基准测试中达到最优性能，同时在质量理解和描述任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅依赖分数监督的泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Motivation: 当前治疗滑车发育不良的方法依赖低分辨率MR扫描和外科医生经验，手术效果不一致且微创技术应用有限。

Method: 流程包括：1）使用隐式神经表示生成各向同性超分辨率MR体积；2）多标签网络分割骨骼；3）小波扩散模型生成伪健康目标形态。

Result: 在25名患者中验证，显著改善了滑车角度和滑车沟深度。

Conclusion: 该方法为术前规划提供了高分辨率3D形态，减少辐射且效果显著。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Motivation: 侧脑室（LV）形状分析作为神经系统疾病的生物标志物具有潜力，但由于个体间形状差异大和MRI分辨率限制导致的分割困难，仍存在挑战。

Method: LV-Net通过结合解剖学关系的联合模板，减少分割伪影并增强重建鲁棒性；通过分类模板网格顶点以改善点对应性。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习框架和渐进注意力机制显著提升了HMER性能，减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升现有模型的性能上限，无需修改架构或额外数据。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，缺乏颜色信息导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM均优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低了1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明JoNet网络在SOD和COD任务上均表现出色，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS的结合能够高效地联合学习SOD和COD任务，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

TL;DR: LiLoRA是一种高效的架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型在持续视觉指令调整中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过共享LoRA矩阵和低秩分解减少参数开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续视觉指令调整中灾难性遗忘和参数效率低的问题。

Method: 共享LoRA矩阵A，对矩阵B进行低秩分解，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失。

Result: 在多样化CVIT基准测试中表现优异，显著提高了参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA在持续任务学习中表现优越且高效。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令编辑潜力大但受限于训练数据不足，尤其是视频编辑。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（先图像后视频），结合拼贴和生成模型数据合成，设计高效编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: DreamVE为指令编辑提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Result: 在空间理解和细粒度感知任务中优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过空间感知和动态注意力校正，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo在少步视频生成中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过结合两种策略，实现了高效且高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

Result: 在UCF-Crime、XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上分别达到91.58% AUC，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特定专家和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，在多模态任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLMs在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Conclusion: 为医学影像提供了一种在标签稀缺情况下的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Conclusion: UGD-IML框架在性能、不确定估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异，为图像篡改定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Method: MCA框架包含多模态联合标签校正（MJC）和多级自适应对齐（MAA）策略。

Result: 在传统和噪声3D基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCA展示了在噪声标签条件下的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Result: 测试数据上获得82%的Dice分数和6.58像素的Hausdorff距离，性能优于LLM驱动的LanGuideMedSeg（提升37%）及纯图像模型xLSTM-UNet和nnUNet。

Conclusion: Text-Swin-UMamba模型在病灶分割任务中表现优异，验证了文本与影像结合的有效性。

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical
assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language
models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to
combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the
radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对精确及时环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在空间和时间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: WGAST采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，并结合弱监督训练策略。

Result: WGAST在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%，并能有效捕捉细尺度热模式。

Conclusion: WGAST是首个端到端深度学习框架，能够高效估计每日10米分辨率的LST，并在实际应用中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法依赖Transformer融合，存在计算复杂度高和缺乏空间先验的问题，限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的柱状LiDAR表示替代直方图表示；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合架构（GM-Fusion），用高效的状态空间模型替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive实现了新的SOTA性能，显著优于DiffusionDrive。

Conclusion: 任务特定的状态空间模型在自动驾驶任务中，性能和效率上均优于通用Transformer。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: SynSeg提出了一种新的弱监督方法，通过多类别对比学习和特征协同结构，显著提升了开放词汇场景下的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇场景下的语义分割面临语义类别广泛和细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法因依赖类别特定监督和不适合的特征构建方法导致性能不佳。

Method: SynSeg采用多类别对比学习（MCCL）和特征协同结构（FSS），结合类别内和类别间的对齐与分离，并通过特征重构避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg优于现有最优方法，例如在VOC上准确率提升4.5%，Context上提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg在弱监督下显著提升了语义定位和区分能力，为开放词汇语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Motivation: 研究旨在比较不同表示学习算法在卫星图像天气分类任务中的表现，探索潜在空间对分类性能的影响。

Method: 使用了主成分分析（PCA）、卷积自编码器（CAE）和预训练残差网络（PT）三种算法，并在不同分辨率和潜在空间尺寸下进行实验。

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现最佳，PCA命中率高但误报率也高，PT在热带气旋识别中表现突出但其他任务较差。高分辨率数据集对深度学习算法更有利，潜在空间尺寸小于128会导致误报率显著上升。

Conclusion: CAE能高效学习潜在空间，但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息增强的CAE版本。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Result: 实验表明，SC-Captioner能生成更准确的图像描述，显著优于直接偏好优化策略。

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习框架和精细的奖励设计，有效提升了图像描述模型的自我纠正能力和生成质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

TL;DR: VeSCA是一种新方法，通过利用SAM的编码器生成可转移的对抗样本，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估SAM的可转移漏洞对下游应用的安全性至关重要。

Method: VeSCA通过参数化单纯复形和顶点细化迭代，识别共享脆弱区域。

Result: VeSCA在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了SAM漏洞对下游模型的风险，呼吁开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Conclusion: 论文提出的扩散模型框架有效融合了IMU和视觉信号，解决了视觉信息缺失的问题，并在性能上达到了先进水平。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准，有效提升评估质量。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived

text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.

Conclusion: DSConv在图像融合任务中表现出优越性，并提供了最佳使用条件。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC不仅提高了AD诊断的准确性，还提供了模型的可解释性，为AD研究提供了新的证据。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Motivation: 研究在资源有限平台上部署扩散模型时，减少去噪步骤与降低每步计算成本哪种更有效。

Result: 实验表明，降低每步计算成本比减少去噪步骤更能提升效率与保真度。

Conclusion: PostDiff显著优化了扩散模型的效率与保真度权衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化加速导致公共场景犯罪威胁增加，传统方法难以捕捉高级语义或满足实时需求。

Method: 将视频流转为语义描述，构建因果一致的历史摘要，融合长短上下文进行联合推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，提供高质量犯罪行为数据集。

Conclusion: MA-CBP为城市公共安全风险预警提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸腔积液CT图像的语义分割面临灰度相似、边缘模糊和形态多变等挑战，现有方法因直接特征拼接导致语义鸿沟，难以应对多样图像变化。

Method: 模型采用密集嵌套跳跃连接网络，创新性地设计了双域特征解耦模块（DDFD）和分支交互注意力融合模块（BIAF），实现多尺度特征互补和动态加权融合。

Result: 在1622张CT图像上验证，IoU和Dice分数分别达到80.1%和89.0%，优于U-Net++和Swin-UNet。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸腔积液CT图像的分割精度，为临床诊断提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法过于专业化，限制了其泛化能力，需要一种通用框架。

Method: AnomalyMoE将问题分解为三个语义层次，并分别使用专家网络处理，同时引入EIR和ESB模块优化专家多样性及利用率。

Result: 在8个数据集上实验表明，AnomalyMoE显著优于领域专用方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和专家模块实现了通用且高效的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Result: 数据集扩展了现有范围，展示了物体物理属性对人类姿势、速度、运动规模和交互策略的影响。

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集能够与现有运动生成方法结合，验证其传递真实物理感知的能力。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性未被广泛采用，手动评分效率低，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）提取疾病相关图像区域；2）通过注意力机制和多实例学习整合区域特征进行预测。提出两种区域提取方案：采样异常区域或裁剪关节区域。

Result: 最佳模型PCC为0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC提升至0.945，RMSE降至15.57，接近放射科医生水平（PCC=0.97，RMSE=18.75）。

Conclusion: 该流程能有效识别临床相关的解剖结构，为RA进展提供决策支持。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地理对象的细微纹理差异和相似空间结构易导致语义模糊和误分类，同时不规则形状和模糊边界增加了分割难度。

Method: 提出TEFormer模型，包含纹理感知模块（TaM）增强语义区分，边缘引导三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留局部边缘细节，以及边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）实现精细分割。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理和边缘机制有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Result: 统一方法性能与专用模型相当，且在未见模糊场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现全场景去模糊，为实际应用提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Method: FedX利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分以减少通信量。

Result: 实验表明，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量，同时提升了全局模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX是一种有效的通信优化方法，适用于遥感图像分类任务。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging

challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based

U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Result: 在三个数据集和六种跨域设置中表现良好。

Conclusion: URPA在少量无标注目标视频下实现了高效跨域时间定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了域偏移问题，减少了对迁移学习或在线训练的依赖，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法在噪声环境下准确推断状态的问题。

Method: 在ViPro基础上添加改进，使其能无监督地从观测中推断状态，并扩展3D数据集。

Result: 模型能够在不提供初始真实状态的情况下正确推断状态，且适用于更复杂的3D场景。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督状态下表现更优，适用于更接近现实的场景。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

TL;DR: 利用街景图像和大型语言模型分析城市社交性，验证了街景数据可用于研究社交互动与建筑环境的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交互动质量，街景图像作为低成本、全球覆盖的数据源可能蕴含潜在社交信息。

Method: 使用多模态大型语言模型分析2998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社交性分类理论，并通过线性回归模型控制其他变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与三种社交性相关，绿色视野指数预测持久社交性，地方依恋与短暂社交性正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可作为研究城市社交性的工具，支持跨文化理论验证和基于证据的城市设计。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过有效令牌选择和跨域评估，显著提升了异常事件分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Result: 通过多组图像和参数测试，验证了算法的有效性和性能。

Conclusion: 该实现展示了改进模型在图像分割中的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在保持（或更好）视觉质量的同时，将采样时间减少了90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提高了稀疏输入视图下下游重建任务的时间效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different
class sizes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel methods
over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化的图表生成方法有效提升了MLLMs的图表理解能力，ECD数据集为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Result: Lightswitch在2D重光照预测质量上超越现有方法，并在合成和真实物体重光照任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Lightswitch通过整合内在属性和多视角数据，显著提升了重光照的效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Conclusion: AEPO有效提升语义对齐能力，为GUI任务提供新解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

Result: 提出了一种具有明确信念与偏好分离、资源感知自由能最小化和模块化结构的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI开发提供了一条更安全的新路径，并通过ARC基准验证其安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,

undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

Result: 通过两个案例研究（信用风险分类和金融时间序列预测）展示了H-XAI的通用性。

Conclusion: H-XAI填补了现有XAI方法的不足，通过结合因果评级和后验解释，满足利益相关者在个体决策和整体模型层面的需求。

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

Result: 论文总结了现有安全挑战、缓解技术及评估工具，提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更安全可靠的具身导航系统提供了指导，并对社会安全和工业效率有广泛影响。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the
development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention,
particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to
perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a
specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied
navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety
and increasing industrial efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的工具检索框架，通过捕捉工具间的语义关系和功能依赖，显著提升了多步任务中的工具检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具检索方法主要依赖用户查询与工具描述的相似性，限制了多步请求的处理能力，因此需要更全面的检索方法。

Method: 利用知识图谱中的1-hop ego工具图集合，建模工具间的直接和间接连接，实现更全面的工具选择。

Result: 在合成数据集上，基于工具图的方法在Complete Recall指标上达到91.85%，优于非KG基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的结构信息为纯相似性匹配提供了补充信号，特别适用于需要顺序工具组合的查询。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理研究多限于语言任务，多模态场景下VLM协作能力不足，需解决错误结果放大的问题。

Method: 采用LLM中介协调多个VLM专家代理，通过输出交换与反思实现协作，避免昂贵GPT模型。

Result: 在五个医疗视觉问答基准上验证，协作性能超越单个代理，无需模型训练。

Conclusion: 中介引导的多代理协作可推动医疗多模态智能发展，代码将开源。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM在动态、长期任务（如《星际争霸II》）中表现不佳，需要解决资源管理和环境适应性问题。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架，包括专家模仿学习智能体和元控制器（Strategic Planner），生成多步动作序列并协调为统一计划。

Result: HIMA在战略清晰性、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合专家模仿模块和元级协调可开发更鲁棒的通用AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化资源分配中的能力，并解决现有基准的数据污染和静态性问题。

Method: 通过三种提示策略（贪婪选择、直接优化和爬山式优化）让LLM在可行性约束下选择项目子集，并与效用最大化基准对比。

Result: 结果表明提示设计对LLM表现至关重要，且LLM在无结构输入机制设计中具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLM在资源分配和偏好推断方面表现出潜力，提示设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知想象力在人类思维中扮演重要角色，但目前被低估，限制了AI的能力。论文旨在强调其重要性并推动相关研究。

Method: 提出语义模型，一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，能够学习和模拟认知想象力。

Result: 语义模型能够确保想象上下文的连贯性，并实现透明操作，为AI推理提供新工具。

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI发展的关键突破点，语义模型为其模拟提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有方法在随时行为上的不足，且缺乏系统性比较，作者提出了一种新的算法来改进决策树学习的效率和效果。

Method: CA-DL8.5通过模块化设计整合多种启发式和松弛机制，结合DL8.5的高效剪枝和缓存技术，采用重启波束搜索逐步放宽剪枝标准。

Result: 实验表明，基于LDS启发式的CA-DL8.5在随时性能上优于其他变体和Blossom算法，同时保持完整性和最优性。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5为决策树学习提供了一个通用框架，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Result: 在CARLA模拟器上的实验表明，ME³-BEV在碰撞率和轨迹精度等指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ME³-BEV为实时自动驾驶提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Result: 证明GNNs的逻辑表达能力严格超过C2。

Conclusion: GNNs的表达能力超越C2，同时对无穷逻辑的表达能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法能有效处理复杂任务，具有灵活的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

TL;DR: SKATE是一种新型评估框架，通过让大语言模型相互生成和解决可验证任务来评估其能力，具有自动化、可扩展和客观性等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法需要大量领域专业知识，难以跟上大语言模型的快速发展，因此需要一种更高效、可扩展的评估框架。

Method: SKATE框架将评估视为游戏，模型既作为任务生成者又作为解决者，通过生成可验证任务（如代码输出预测挑战）来相互测试。

Result: 实验表明，SKATE能有效区分模型能力，揭示模型间的细微差异，并观察到模型的自偏好行为。

Conclusion: SKATE为通用、可扩展的评估框架提供了重要进展，能够跟上大语言模型的发展步伐。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

Result: 特征重要性因模型而异，但某些特征始终是强预测因子。

Conclusion: 特征重要性分析可为元启发式算法提供指导机制的基础。

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

Motivation: 药物禁忌信息的准确性对医疗决策至关重要，但LLMs在此领域的应用存在挑战。研究旨在通过RAG框架提升LLMs的可靠性。

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4o-mini作为基础模型，结合text-embedding-3-small模型和Langchain工具，构建混合检索系统，并利用公共数据库中的药物使用审查（DUR）数据。

Result: RAG框架显著提升了模型准确性，在年龄组、妊娠和联合用药三个类别的禁忌信息中，准确率分别达到0.94、0.87和0.89。

Conclusion: 研究表明，RAG框架可以有效减少药物禁忌信息的不确定性，为处方和用药决策提供更可靠的依据。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Conclusion: 置信度驱动的风险感知评估是提升LLM-as-a-Judge系统可靠性的关键，TH-Score和LLM-as-a-Fuser为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

*Yumeng Fu,Jiayin Zhu,Lingling Zhang,Bo Zhao,Shaoxuan Ma,Yushun Zhang,Yanrui Wu,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoLaux基准测试填补了现有MLLM几何能力评估的空白，重点关注辅助线构建和长步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视辅助线构建和细粒度过程评估，无法全面评估MLLM的几何推理能力。

Method: 提出GeoLaux基准测试，包含2,186道几何题，设计五维评估策略。

Result: 实验发现MLLM在长步推理中性能显著下降，缺乏辅助线意识。

Conclusion: GeoLaux可作为评估和改进MLLM几何推理能力的基准和指南。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

*Ruben Sharma,Sebastijan Dumančić,Ross D. King,Andrew Cropper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯归纳逻辑编程方法，通过平衡假设复杂性和数据拟合，从噪声数据中学习最小消息长度程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一概率和逻辑学习是AI领域的关键挑战。

Method: 使用先验和似然函数，平衡假设复杂性和数据拟合，学习最小消息长度程序。

Result: 在游戏和药物设计等多个领域显著优于先前方法，且数据高效、对示例平衡不敏感。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个领域表现出色，能够从仅有的正例中学习。

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general
programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on
several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

*Andrew Cropper,David M. Cerna,Matti Järvisalo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种打破假设空间对称性的方法，显著提高了归纳逻辑编程的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 归纳逻辑编程中假设空间庞大且存在大量逻辑等价假设，导致搜索效率低下。

Method: 通过打破假设空间的对称性，并在答案集编程中实现该方法。

Result: 在视觉推理和游戏等多个领域的实验中，求解时间从超过一小时缩短至17秒。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了归纳逻辑编程中的搜索效率问题，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that
generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching
vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent
hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break
symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set
programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning
and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an
hour to just 17 seconds.

TL;DR: PRISM Eval开发了BET工具，通过动态对抗优化实现100%攻击成功率，并提出细粒度鲁棒性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的鲁棒性，揭示不同模型在对抗攻击中的脆弱性差异。

Method: 使用BET工具进行自动化红队测试，结合动态对抗优化和原始级漏洞分析。

Result: 在41个先进LLM中，37个被100%攻破，攻击难度差异达300倍。

Conclusion: 提出了分布式鲁棒性评估的实用路径，为社区提供了改进LLM安全性的方法。

Abstract: This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by
PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior
Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through
Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we
propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of
attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty
varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We
introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

### [121] [A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326)
*Nathaniel Virgo,Martin Biehl,Manuel Baltieri,Matteo Capucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了Conant和Ashby的定理，提出了一种更广义的模型概念，认为观察者在定义模型时起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conant和Ashby的定理在更广泛的系统中难以适用，因此需要一种更通用的模型定义。

Method: 通过引入观察者的视角，将模型定义为外部强加于系统的信念更新过程。

Result: 证明了无论系统是调节环境还是内部状态，都可以被解释为具有模型。

Conclusion: 模型的存在依赖于观察者的解释，从而解决了原有定理的局限性。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的机器学习模型AntiCheatPT_256，用于检测《反恐精英2》中的作弊行为，并公开了数据集CS2CD。模型在测试集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线游戏中的作弊行为破坏了游戏体验的公平性，现有反作弊系统（如VAC）难以在不侵犯用户隐私的情况下应对不断演变的作弊手段。

Method: 使用公开数据集CS2CD（包含795场比赛），生成并增强90,707个上下文窗口，训练Transformer模型AntiCheatPT_256。

Result: 模型在未增强测试集上达到89.17%的准确率和93.36%的AUC。

Conclusion: 该方法强调可重复性和实际应用性，为数据驱动的作弊检测研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

### [123] [From Explainable to Explanatory Artificial Intelligence: Toward a New Paradigm for Human-Centered Explanations through Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06352)
*Christian Meske,Justin Brenne,Erdi Uenal,Sabahat Oelcer,Ayseguel Doganguen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出“解释性AI”作为可解释AI（XAI）的补充范式，强调通过生成式AI能力支持人类理解，而非仅提供算法透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI方法过于关注算法透明度，提供的解释抽象且非自适应，难以满足终端用户的理解需求。

Method: 提出一个八维概念模型，强调叙事沟通、自适应个性化和渐进披露原则，并通过医疗专业人员的实证研究验证。

Result: 用户更偏好上下文敏感的多模态解释，而非技术透明度。

Conclusion: AI系统应设计为支持人类理解，而非仅关注算法内省，为跨领域和文化背景的用户中心解释方法提供了研究议程。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

*Claudia dAmato,Giuseppe Rubini,Francesco Didio,Donato Francioso,Fatima Zahra Amara,Nicola Fanizzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种构建法律知识图谱的方法，填补法律领域知识图谱的空白，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律决策需要全面的法律背景知识和最新案例信息，但法律领域知识图谱稀缺，因此开发针对暴力侵害妇女案件的法律知识图谱。

Method: 采用系统自下而上方法和基于大语言模型的新方法，结合结构化数据提取、本体开发和语义增强构建知识图谱。

Result: 构建的法律知识图谱通过验证，可提升法律信息可访问性，支持复杂查询和机器学习工具。

Conclusion: 开发的法律知识图谱对法律信息访问和预测性司法具有重要价值。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

### [125] [The Fair Game: Auditing & Debiasing AI Algorithms Over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06443)
*Debabrota Basu,Udvas Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态机制“Fair Game”，通过结合审计员和去偏算法，利用强化学习实现公平性目标随时间调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性定义多为观察性且相互冲突，难以在动态社会环境中实际应用，需要一种灵活适应的方法。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，将审计员和去偏算法循环结合，动态调整公平性目标。

Result: “Fair Game”能够模拟社会伦理和法律框架的演变，提供灵活的前后部署公平性解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架为公平机器学习提供了一种动态适应的方法，能够应对社会环境的持续变化。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

*Joshua Caiata,Ben Armstrong,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的框架，用于评估投票规则在不同偏好分布下违反公理的频率，并通过神经网络展示了其在减少公理违反方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多赢家投票规则在实际偏好分布中的公理表现，以补充最坏情况分析的二元视角。

Method: 采用数据驱动框架，分析多种偏好分布下投票规则与公理性能的关系，并引入神经网络作为投票规则。

Result: 神经网络作为投票规则在减少公理违反方面优于传统规则。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可为新投票系统的设计提供信息，并支持社会选择领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.
