Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于检测针对女性的仇恨和性别歧视内容，包含三个模块，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的仇恨内容较多，现有方法难以有效检测，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态框架，包含注意力模块、图特征重构模块和内容特征学习模块，结合词典和测试时增强。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，宏F1平均提升10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了针对女性的仇恨内容检测性能。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升视觉语言模型在工业异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，视觉语言模型虽具泛化优势但性能不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段使用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强异常感知；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现从感知到解释的跃升。

Result: 在7个VLMs上显著提升，平均准确率最高提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型超越GPT-4.1等商业模型。

Conclusion: IAD-R1有效且优越，数据集、代码和模型权重将开源。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [3] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新型的神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合了视觉语言模型和粒子滤波推理，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测AR认知攻击时，要么缺乏语义推理能力，要么依赖黑盒模型，可解释性不足。

Method: CADAR通过融合多模态视觉语言输入生成符号感知图，并利用粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 在扩展的AR认知攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确率提高了10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在AR认知攻击检测中具有高效性和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [4] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将敏感视觉数据转换为隐私保护的文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及导致隐私与数据需求之间的严重冲突，现有隐私保护机制不足。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，优化生成文本的语义准确性和隐私保护。

Result: 在CFP-FP数据集上，RL-MoE将重放攻击成功率降至9.4%，同时生成更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动了更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

### [5] [Synthetic Data Generation for Emotional Depth Faces: Optimizing Conditional DCGANs via Genetic Algorithms in the Latent Space and Stabilizing Training with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09188)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算中高质量、多样化深度面部数据集的缺乏问题。

Method: 使用优化的GAN和知识蒸馏（EMA教师模型）稳定训练，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提取多种特征进行分类。

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，分类准确率达94%-96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成和分类任务中均优于现有技术，为情感计算提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Δ-AttnMask框架，通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码量化样本质量，仅需20%数据即可实现最优性能，训练速度提升5倍，准确率提高10.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）需要多模态数据以实现视觉和文本的联合理解，但数据选择问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Δ-AttnMask框架，通过计算原始状态与高注意力区域掩码状态之间的损失差异（Δ）来评估样本质量。

Result: 实验表明，Δ-AttnMask仅需20%数据即可实现最优性能，训练速度提升5倍，准确率提高10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask的模型无关和数据无关设计使其在多模态和架构中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

### [7] [Personalized Feature Translation for Expression Recognition: An Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09202)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法通常不适用于仅含单类目标数据的情况，且图像生成方法不稳定且计算量大。

Method: 在潜在空间中预训练翻译器，优化表情一致性和风格感知目标，然后在目标数据上适应，无需源数据或图像合成。

Result: PFT避免了表情生成的复杂性和噪声，生成优化的分类嵌入，减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: PFT是一种高效的方法，优于基于图像的翻译方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most
effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images
close to those created by humans.

TL;DR: MME-Emotion是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情感情感和推理能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感基准测试在泛化能力和推理能力方面存在不足，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出了MME-Emotion基准测试，包含6000多个视频片段和任务特定的问答对，涵盖八种情感任务，并采用混合指标和多代理系统框架进行评估。

Result: 评估了20个先进MLLMs，发现其情感情感表现不佳，最佳模型识别得分仅为39.3%，推理得分为56.0%。

Conclusion: MME-Emotion为未来提升MLLMs的情感情感能力提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

### [10] [Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09218)
*Zuoou Li,Weitong Zhang,Jingyuan Wang,Shuyuan Zhang,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz,Mengyun Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四轴评估框架和递归重写策略BSD，用于更准确地评估和提升对抗性提示的攻击效果，揭示了当前多模态安全系统的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性提示评估标准可能高估攻击效果，且安全机制存在漏洞，需要更准确的评估方法和更有效的攻击策略。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入相关性、OOD强度、输出危害性、拒绝率）和递归重写策略BSD，平衡相关性和新颖性以绕过安全检测。

Result: BSD在13个MLLMs中显著提高了攻击成功率和危害性，成功率提升67%，危害性提升21%。

Conclusion: BSD揭示了当前多模态安全系统的潜在弱点，为未来安全机制改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

Motivation: 由于手工标注成本高，HMER领域数据稀缺，限制了模型性能的提升。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据引擎，生成复杂且一致的LaTeX序列，结合手写和LaTeX渲染公式进行混合训练。

Result: 构建了包含8000万高质量样本的Tex80M数据集，TexTeller模型在几乎所有基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过大规模数据集和混合训练方法，显著提升了HMER性能，并公开模型、数据集和代码以推动领域发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

TL;DR: GDAGS提出了一种基于梯度方向感知的自适应密度控制框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建和过密集问题，显著降低了内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中存在过重建和过密集问题，导致内存开销增加和渲染质量下降。

Method: 通过梯度一致性比率（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，实现梯度方向感知的密度控制。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS有效解决了3D高斯泼溅中的关键问题，优化了高斯利用，构建了紧凑的场景表示。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

TL;DR: FineState-Bench是一个新的评估框架，专注于GUI代理的细粒度控制能力，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理评估框架过于关注粗粒度任务完成，忽视了细粒度控制能力的重要性。

Method: 引入FineState-Bench，包含2257个任务基准和四阶段指标，并开发了视觉诊断助手（VDA）进行定量分析。

Result: 实验显示最先进模型在细粒度交互准确率仅为32.8%，理想视觉定位可提升性能14.9%。

Conclusion: 当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基础视觉定位能力，FineState-Bench为未来研究提供了开源工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

TL;DR: FiGPriv提出了一种细粒度隐私保护框架，通过选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息，同时保留低风险信息，提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对盲人和低视力用户在使用视觉助手时可能无意中捕捉到私人信息的隐私问题，现有方法过于粗糙，影响了可用性。

Method: 结合细粒度分割和数据驱动的风险评分机制，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上测试，FiGPriv保留了26%的图像内容，提升了视觉语言模型的响应能力11%，识别图像内容能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了系统的可用性和功能性。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量时会导致性能显著下降，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了三种自适应算法：选择性处理全景视图、基于重要性的自适应阈值和缓存机制。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少了2倍以上。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型效率，适用于计算资源有限的实际场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is
publicly available at

*Alexandre Brown,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDAC是一种基于分割的视觉强化学习方法，通过结合SAM和YOLO-World实现对象中心分解和语义标注，显著提升了视觉泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要同时处理高维输入和噪声奖励，现有大模型在RL中的整合效果不明确，因此需要一种新方法来提升泛化能力和效率。

Method: SegDAC结合SAM进行对象中心分解，使用YOLO-World通过文本提示进行语义标注，并采用新型Transformer架构动态选择关注的分割区域。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上表现优异，最难任务性能翻倍，样本效率也优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分割和动态注意力机制，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率，为复杂视觉任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

TL;DR: Lung-DDPM+是一种改进的生成模型，通过语义布局引导和加速采样，显著提升了效率和精度，适用于肺癌诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺癌诊断中存在效率低和解剖学不精确的问题，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出Lung-DDPM+，结合语义布局引导和DPM-solver加速，优化采样效率和质量。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上，FLOPs减少8倍，GPU内存消耗降低6.8倍，采样速度提升14倍，同时保持样本质量。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Conclusion: 基于注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成方法为复杂多模态手势识别提供了鲁棒且准确的框架。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CSLR中手语者间差异大和未见句子泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 使用Signer-Invariant Conformer（结合卷积和多头自注意力）处理SI任务，Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer（双路径时间编码器）处理US任务。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，SI任务WER降低13.53%，US任务WER达到47.78%，在SignEval 2025挑战赛中表现优异。

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计显著提升CSLR性能，为后续研究奠定新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

*Kumar Abhishek,Jeremy Kawahara,Ghassan Hamarneh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了医学图像分割中注释者间的变异性，发现注释一致性（IAA）与皮肤病变的恶性程度显著相关，并利用IAA作为多任务学习的软特征，提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释者的变异性（如边界模糊、注释者偏好等）影响结果准确性，尤其是恶性病变的注释一致性较低。研究旨在量化这种变异性并利用其提升模型性能。

Method: 构建了IMA++数据集，研究注释者、恶性程度等因素对IAA的影响，并开发了从图像预测IAA的模型，将其作为多任务学习的软特征。

Result: 发现IAA与恶性程度显著相关（p<0.001），预测IAA的模型误差为0.108，多任务学习使平衡准确率平均提升4.2%。

Conclusion: IAA可作为临床特征的补充，提升皮肤病变分割模型的性能，尤其在恶性病变中效果显著。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-UniMotion提出了一种统一的隐式潜在表示方法，用于捕捉全身人体运动（包括面部表情、身体姿势和手势），并通过自监督学习框架实现高保真的跨身份运动迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式骨骼姿势和启发式跨身份调整，难以实现高保真且身份无关的运动迁移。

Method: 通过四组解耦的潜在令牌（面部、身体、双手）编码运动，结合DiT视频生成模型和自监督学习框架，利用2D/3D增强技术实现运动-身份解耦。

Result: 实验表明，X-UniMotion在运动保真度和身份保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion提供了一种高效且表达丰富的运动表示方法，适用于跨身份的高质量动画生成。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Motivation: 解决SAR目标检测中相干噪声的普遍影响，现有方法多依赖空间域特征分析或增强。

Method: 设计注意力架构，在变换域解构和调制特征，利用振幅和相位信息的互补性进行互调制。

Result: 在多个SAR数据集上表现优异，SARDet-100K数据集上比DenoDet V1提升0.8%，模型复杂度减半。

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制，显著提升了性能并降低了复杂度，为SAR目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

which are notoriously difficult for conventional sensors like RGB cameras,
LiDAR, and depth cameras to detect. This paper introduces SkyShield, an
event-driven, end-to-end framework designed for the perception of submillimeter
scale obstacles. Drawing upon the unique features that thin obstacles present
in the event stream, our method employs a lightweight U-Net architecture and an
innovative Dice-Contour Regularization Loss to ensure precise detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our event-based approach achieves mean F1
Score of 0.7088 with a low latency of 21.2 ms, making it ideal for deployment

Conclusion: 贡献了首个大规模高质量路缘坡道数据集、基准和模型。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Conclusion: 系统适用于家庭公民科学级生物多样性记录。

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard
bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads
short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Result: 实验表明PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文成功填补了动作语义与空间上下文联合建模的空白，并提供了新数据集和高效框架。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Conclusion: RelayFormer在视觉篡改定位任务中表现出色，具有高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

TL;DR: GEN-AFFECT是一个用于生成个性化2D头像的框架，通过多模态扩散变换器实现身份一致性和丰富表情表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细粒度面部表情和保持身份一致性方面表现不足。

Method: 使用多模态扩散变换器，结合身份-表情表示，并通过一致注意力机制在推理阶段共享信息。

Result: 在表情准确性、身份保持和一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEN-AFFECT能够生成身份一致且表情丰富的个性化头像。

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

TL;DR: GOAL是一个基于生成流的框架，通过结合LLM增强的全场景语义地图，建模室内环境的语义分布，提升物体导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖确定性模型完成语义地图，忽略了室内布局的不确定性，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 利用LLM推断的空间先验，编码为二维高斯场注入目标地图，将上下文知识蒸馏到流模型中。

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成式建模和LLM知识增强，显著提升了物体导航任务的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes
and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Badi-Li/GOAL.

TL;DR: Video-EM是一种无需训练的框架，通过模拟人类情景记忆，解决了Video-LLMs在长视频理解中的关键帧冗余和时空关系缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将长视频简化为静态关键帧匹配，忽略了时空关系和场景连续性，导致信息冗余和准确性下降。

Method: Video-EM将关键帧建模为时序事件，结合空间关系和时序动态，并利用LLMs的链式思维迭代筛选最小但信息丰富的记忆子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，且使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆建模和链式思维，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语生成领域仍需探索，现有方法在平衡分辨率和细节方面存在不足。

Method: 结合ProGAN和SAGAN的GAN变体，生成特征丰富、高分辨率的类别条件手语图像。

Result: 在IS和FID指标上分别提升了3.2和30.12，并发布了一个包含印度手语字母、数字和129个单词的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在手语图像生成中表现出色，为手语交流提供了高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

*Jiateng Liu,Hengcan Shi,Feng Chen,Zhiwen Shao,Yaonan Wang,Jianfei Cai,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT)的新方法，通过微调大型预训练模型（LMs）来适应微表情识别（MER）任务，解决了现有方法难以捕捉细微面部运动的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别在情感计算领域具有重要应用，但由于标注困难，数据集样本稀缺，限制了模型的学习能力。现有大型预训练模型无法直接用于MER，因为它们难以捕捉短暂且细微的面部运动。

Method: MPT通过运动提示生成（包括运动放大和高斯标记化）提取细微运动作为提示，并结合精心设计的组适配器增强模型在MER领域的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT是一种创新的方法，能够有效提升大型预训练模型在微表情识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: COXNet是一种新型RGBT微小物体检测框架，通过跨层融合、动态对齐和优化标签分配策略，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机场景中，RGBT图像中的微小物体检测面临空间错位、低光照和复杂背景等挑战，现有方法难以有效利用多模态信息。

Method: COXNet提出三个核心创新：跨层融合模块、动态对齐与尺度细化模块，以及基于GeoShape相似性度量的标签分配策略。

Result: 在RGBTDronePerson数据集上，COXNet比现有方法提升了3.32%的mAP50。

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出色，为RGBT微小物体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的检索增强超分辨率（RASR）方法，通过自动检索相关高分辨率参考图像来提升纹理保真度和视觉真实感，解决了现有方法依赖手动配对的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的超分辨率方法依赖手动配对的参考图像，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出RASR方法，结合语义检索器和扩散生成器，自动检索相关参考图像并生成高质量结果。

Result: 在RASR-Flickr30数据集上，RASRNet比SISR基线提升0.38 dB PSNR和-0.0131 LPIPS，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究与实际应用的有前景方向。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航指令生成依赖结构化输入，限制了在未知和非结构化环境中的适应性。GoViG旨在仅通过视觉数据生成指令，提高通用性。

Method: 任务分解为视觉预测和指令生成两个子任务，结合多模态大语言模型和两种推理策略（单次和交替推理）。

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优于现有方法，BLEU-4和CIDEr分数显著提升，具有跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GoViG通过视觉数据和多模态模型实现了高效导航指令生成，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于光谱差异和可用观测数据的稀缺，直接将基础模型应用于高光谱遥感具有挑战性。

Method: HyperKD通过特征级策略（包括基于光谱范围的通道对齐、空间特征引导掩码和增强的损失函数）解决逆域适应问题。

Result: 实验表明，HyperKD显著提高了MAE中的表示学习，增强了重建保真度和下游任务的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HyperKD为高光谱遥感分析中的知识蒸馏框架提供了潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN通过分层整合结构和形态连接组，显著提升了IDH突变预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

Result: 实验证明 Animate-X++ 在通用动画图像上的优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: Animate-X++ 解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了动画的真实感和适用性。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

Motivation: 减少医学成像中的辐射暴露，并扩展2D InDI概念至3D医学图像处理。

Method: 采用迭代去噪过程，直接从稀疏视图输入优化CBCT体积，并利用大规模伪CBCT数据集进行训练。

Result: 在CT-RATE测试集上PSNR增益12.96 dB，辐射暴露降低8倍，临床评估表现良好。

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在稀疏视图CBCT伪影去除中高效且可扩展，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉定位任务中表现出色，但其安全性问题，尤其是后门攻击，尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用文本条件U-Net将攻击目标的语义信息嵌入原始图像，并通过重建损失确保攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 在InternVL-2.5-8B上ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上攻击效果显著。

Conclusion: IAG攻击方法具有鲁棒性和可迁移性，为视觉语言模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,
well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models
demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid

*Gerardo Loza,Junlei Hu,Dominic Jones,Sharib Ali,Pietro Valdastri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NeRF的新型测试时优化（TTO）方法，用于长期3D点跟踪，显著提升了2D和3D跟踪的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点跟踪方法在一致性运动或3D跟踪方面表现不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用可逆NeRF（InvNeRF）架构参数化函数，结合多尺度HexPlanes和高效像素采样算法，实现双向可变形-规范映射。

Result: 在2D跟踪中平均精度提升近50%，在3D跟踪中首次超越前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了可变形NeRF的优势，显著提升了点跟踪性能。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于区域到区域变换的图像协调方法R2R，通过Clear-VAE和Harmony Controller提升细节保留和协调能力，并构建了新的合成数据集RPHarmony。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LDM的协调方法在细节保留和协调能力上存在不足，且合成数据集缺乏真实光照变化。

Method: 设计了Clear-VAE和Harmony Controller（含MACA模块），并提出Random Poisson Blending生成多样化合成数据。

Conclusion: R2R方法有效提升了图像协调的细节保留和动态调整能力，新数据集为研究提供了更丰富的训练资源。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖对齐相同表面，而互锁形状需要同时考虑表面形状相同和体积占用相反的特性。

Result: 在几何组装基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模互锁特性，实现了更鲁棒的形状组装。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

TL;DR: CitySeg是一个用于城市规模点云语义分割的基础模型，通过结合文本模态实现开放词汇分割和零样本推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型因数据规模有限和数据集间领域差距导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 提出局部-全局交叉注意力网络、分层分类策略和两阶段训练方法。

Result: 在九个封闭集基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并首次实现不依赖视觉信息的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: CitySeg通过创新方法显著提升了点云分割的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

<details>

Motivation: 解决脑组织照片分割中需要昂贵人工干预的问题。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合手动标注和合成图像训练模型。

Result: 模型在未见过的照片上表现优异，Dice分数中位数超过0.98。

Conclusion: 工具公开可用，性能接近人工标注，适用于脑库和神经病理实验室。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的少样本深度伪造检测方法FTNet，通过利用少量样本显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，深度伪造检测模型在未知样本上表现不佳，但这些样本仍可用于分析，因此应将其视为少样本任务。

Method: 提出FTNet，仅使用一个伪造样本和真实样本进行比较分类，无需训练或参数更新。

Result: 在29种生成模型的测试中，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新的SoTA。

Conclusion: 利用失败样本可以提升少样本深度伪造检测性能，为现实世界检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏人工标签时难以学习复杂运动物理，或需要额外标签。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，并估计物理参数。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上表现出色，尤其在未来帧外推任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRACE不仅能建模复杂物理运动，还能通过聚类物理参数轻松分割多个物体或部件。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态混合面部专家（MoFE）方法和专门处理大角度面部数据的数据处理流程，显著提升了视频生成中的身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在大角度面部情况下难以保持身份一致性，主要由于缺乏有效的身份特征整合机制和针对大角度面部的数据集。

Method: 引入MoFE，结合三个专家模块（身份、语义、细节）动态捕捉面部特征；设计数据处理流程（Face Constraints和Identity Consistency）以增强数据集质量。

Result: 在LFA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在面部相似性、FID和CLIP语义对齐上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部视频生成中的身份保持问题，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: RayletDF在3D表面重建中表现出高效性和强大的泛化能力，适用于多种输入数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Conclusion: 该方法通过异常检测和无监督学习，实现了对未见生成模型的泛化检测。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

Conclusion: COME通过协作异构专家设计，有效解决了多数据集训练中的干扰问题，为超声图像分析提供了通用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Conclusion: GazeLT通过有效利用放射科医生的视觉注意力时序信息，显著提升了长尾疾病分类的性能，为自动化医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

Result: SkySplat在DFC19数据集上MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，速度提升86倍，并在MVS3D基准测试中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkySplat为稀疏卫星图像的三维重建提供了高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: GPT-4o生成的合成图像数据弥补了真实数据在罕见场景和干净监督上的不足，Echo-4o-Image数据集提升了开源模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索合成图像数据的优势，以解决真实数据在罕见场景和噪声问题上的局限性。

Method: 利用GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调Bagel模型得到Echo-4o。

Result: Echo-4o在标准基准测试中表现优异，且数据集对其他基础模型也有显著提升效果。

Conclusion: 合成图像数据是真实数据的有效补充，尤其在罕见场景和干净监督方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义感知重建误差（SARE）的新方法，用于检测扩散模型生成的图像，尤其在面对未见过的生成模型时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法在面对未见过的生成模型时性能下降，因为它们依赖模型特定的伪影。本文探索了假图像与真实图像在语义上的差异。

Method: 通过测量图像与其基于标题的重建之间的语义差异（SARE），量化语义变化，作为检测特征。

Result: 在GenImage和CommunityForensics基准测试中，SARE方法表现出强大的泛化能力，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SARE方法通过捕捉假图像与标题之间的高语义相似性，实现了对多样化生成模型的鲁棒检测。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖图表示和语言模型编码器，但忽略了关键几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。

Method: CWFBind在特征提取阶段整合局部曲率描述符，增强几何表示，并嵌入度感知加权机制以捕捉空间结构差异。

Result: CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现优异，实现了准确性与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何信息增强和动态策略，显著提升了分子对接的精度和实用性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似物体干扰（SOI）是单目标跟踪（SOT）中长期被忽视的关键瓶颈，本文旨在通过实验验证其影响，并探索外部认知引导（如自然语言）的可行性。

Method: 通过在线干扰掩码（OIM）实验量化SOI的影响，构建SOIBench基准，并利用多级注释协议生成精确的语义引导文本。提出了一种基于VLM的新范式，将其作为外部认知引擎集成到RGB跟踪器中。

Result: 消除干扰源显著提升了跟踪性能（AUC增益高达4.35）。现有视觉语言跟踪方法在SOIBench上表现不佳（AUC变化-0.26至+0.71），而提出的VLM方法在语义引导下实现了显著改进（AUC增益高达0.93）。

Conclusion: SOIBench为语义认知跟踪研究提供了标准化评估平台，展示了VLM在提升跟踪性能中的潜力，为跟踪研究社区贡献了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDT通过动态空间衰减机制改进ViT的空间注意力，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT的自注意力机制缺乏显式空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构化任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出SDT，引入上下文感知门控机制（CAG），动态生成数据依赖的空间衰减。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务上表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的空间衰减是增强ViT空间注意力的新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Result: MEUNet在重建精度和推理速度上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合有效解决了测量非相干性和表示学习问题，提升了压缩感知性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非对称立体匹配的两阶段迭代体积融合网络（IVF-AStereo），通过融合两种成本体积来解决视觉不对称问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统立体匹配算法假设双目视觉对称，但非对称多相机系统（如长焦-广角相机）的兴起打破了这一假设，导致匹配困难。

Method: 提出两阶段迭代体积融合网络：首先通过聚合拼接体积优化相关体积，随后融合两种体积以增强细节。

Result: 在非对称场景中表现优异，对显著视觉不对称具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 实验验证了该方法在分辨率和颜色退化情况下的有效性。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

Conclusion: 虽然真实图像通常更优，但研究提供了量化合成数据增强规模的指南，结果在不同数据集和训练集规模下表现一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态门控机制，有效解决了天气扰动下的地理定位问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

Result: 实验表明，DRF能够生成高质量、语义一致且结构一致的图像，支持类不变的结构-外观融合。

Conclusion: DRF是一种有效的训练免费方法，显著提升了可控T2I模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is

Conclusion: SHALE为幻觉问题提供了可扩展、可控的评估工具，揭示了模型对语义扰动的敏感性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and
fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous

eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories
along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level
under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides
evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We
demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决头部虚拟形象的高保真渲染和实时外观编辑的挑战，尤其是在几何和全局外观解耦方面。

Method: 使用表面高斯和体积高斯分别建模头部外观和非朗伯区域，结合FLAME网格和纹理图像，通过UV映射和分层优化实现高质量重建和编辑。

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上，SVG-Head实现了高保真渲染，并首次支持高斯头部虚拟形象的显式纹理图像和实时编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head通过混合表示和优化策略，成功解决了头部虚拟形象的高保真渲染和实时编辑问题。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

TL;DR: FaME是一种无需训练且高效推理的方法，通过识别低质量生成图像并利用其采样轨迹作为负引导，提升生成图像的感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类别到图像生成中虽FID得分高，但常生成扭曲或低质量图像，尤其是某些类别。FID仅评估全局分布对齐，忽略个体样本的感知质量。CFG技术虽提升指标，但可能导致分布偏移和视觉伪影。

Method: FaME利用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成图像，存储其采样轨迹作为负引导，避免未来采样进入低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，FaME在不影响FID的情况下，显著提升了视觉质量。

Conclusion: FaME是一种有效提升生成图像感知质量的方法，且具备扩展到文本到图像生成的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 纯相机方法在自动驾驶的BEV地图分割任务中表现不如LC融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法通过模仿教师架构增加学生模型规模，导致推理成本上升。

Method: 引入轻量级教师助理网络，结合教师和学生的BEV表示，创建共享潜在空间，并通过Young不等式推导蒸馏损失，分解为教师-TA和TA-学生双路径。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BridgeTA比纯相机基线提升4.2% mIoU，比其他先进KD方法提升高达45%。

Conclusion: BridgeTA有效提升了纯相机模型的性能，同时避免了推理成本的增加。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Conclusion: 信息优化框架能客观确定平面数量并减少误检，同时可对检测平面质量排序，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Result: SAD-Splat在分割精度和表示紧凑性之间取得了良好平衡，实验效果优异。

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，并推出了新的基准数据集3D-AS。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Motivation: 现有高精度模型在手部几何与图像外观的对齐上仍不完美，纹理对齐可能是一个未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 提出一个自包含的纹理模块，将像素观测嵌入UV纹理空间，并引入密集对齐损失，结合可微分渲染和已知拓扑的3D手部网格模型。

Result: 通过增强HaMeR模型，系统在精度和真实感上均有提升。

Conclusion: 纹理引导的监督在手部重建中具有显著价值。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Result: MCFM显著提升了识别性能，能更好地捕捉细微解剖结构，提高分类准确率和临床可靠性。

Conclusion: MCFM通过多对比融合增强特征表示，为产前筛查提供了一种高效且临床可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Conclusion: PG-SAM展示了临床适用性，并验证了诊断文本对图像分割的增强效果。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff有效提升生成数据的身份分离性，为人脸识别训练提供更优数据源。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they

To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to

The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

TL;DR: PaCo-FR是一种无监督框架，通过掩码图像建模和像素对齐解决面部表示预训练中的三大挑战，并在少量无标签数据下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉面部特征、空间结构和数据利用效率方面存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合掩码图像建模与像素对齐，引入结构化掩码策略、基于补丁的代码书和空间一致性约束。

Result: 在多种面部分析任务中表现优异，尤其在姿态、遮挡和光照变化场景下显著提升。

Conclusion: PaCo-FR推动了面部表示学习，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

TL;DR: SAFF利用slot attention机制过滤无关特征，提升小样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无关特征会显著降低小样本学习性能，导致混淆和误分类。

Method: 提出SAFF方法，结合slot attention和patch embeddings，通过相似性矩阵量化特征相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAFF能有效过滤无关特征，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma
geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在参考图像和目标图像姿态或动作差异较大时，区域级颜色一致性表现不佳，且依赖外部匹配标注。

Method: 提出MangaDiT模型，结合扩散变换器和动态注意力权重策略的分层注意力机制，通过内部注意力机制隐式发现语义对应关系。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过增强模型感受野和区域级颜色对齐能力，实现了更优的参考引导线稿上色效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: 多模态医学影像数据的快速增长在资源有限的临床环境中带来了存储和传输挑战。

Method: 利用生成式视觉-语言模型的交叉注意力分数对胸部X光进行结构性剪枝，生成高度压缩的图表示，并与临床报告的知识图融合。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus数据集上，NEURAL实现了93.4-97.7%的数据压缩，诊断AUC为0.88-0.95。

Conclusion: NEURAL解决了数据大小与临床效用之间的权衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Result: 模型优于基线方法，在缺失数据情况下表现稳健，有助于开发虚拟活检工具。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态数据融合中表现出色，为快速诊断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Result: 模型在跑道图像数据集上表现优于基线架构，同时能生成校准良好的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键航空应用中的视觉系统认证提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Motivation: 旨在开发一种具备人类类似长期记忆能力的多模态代理，以提升其在复杂任务中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用实体中心的多模态记忆组织方式，结合强化学习训练，并通过M3-Bench基准测试评估性能。

Result: M3-Agent在M3-Bench-robot、M3-Bench-web和VideoMME-long基准测试中分别比基线模型高出6.7%、7.7%和5.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: M3-Agent在多模态代理的长期记忆和推理能力方面取得了显著进展，为实际应用提供了设计参考。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

Motivation: 解决密集LVLMs计算成本高的问题，并探索稀疏MoE架构在多模态任务中的应用挑战。

Method: 引入MoIIE架构，通过模态引导的路由机制分配专家，并提出两阶段训练策略激活MoE和多模态能力。

Result: 实验表明，MoIIE模型在5.5B和11.3B参数规模下性能优于现有开源MoE-LLMs多模态模型。

Conclusion: MoIIE架构在效率和性能上均表现出色，为稀疏多模态模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

Motivation: 探索大规模预训练模型在少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）任务中的应用，解决从有限样本中持续学习新概念同时不遗忘旧概念的问题。

Method: 提出DSS-Prompt方法，在Transformer块中协同使用静态提示（适应预训练与下游数据域差距）和动态提示（捕获实例感知语义），并利用多模态模型生成输入相关的动态提示。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DSS-Prompt表现优于现有方法，显著提升性能并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt通过简单原型分类器在增量任务中无需额外训练即可超越现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

Conclusion: MeMoSORT通过创新方法有效解决了复杂运动和遮挡问题，提升了多目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

TL;DR: MUJICA是一种用于PBR材料超分辨率的跨模态注意力适配器，提升现有SISR模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SISR方法在PBR材料超分辨率中存在跨图不一致、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移问题。

Method: 通过跨图注意力融合特征，保留预训练SISR模型的重建能力。

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上表现优异，且保持跨图一致性。

Conclusion: MUJICA在有限资源下高效训练，并在PBR材料数据集上达到先进性能。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Result: CLIP初期学习低层次视觉特征，后期转向抽象形状表示，影响感知对齐与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了感知对齐与鲁棒性的权衡机制，为优化视觉语言模型提供新思路。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Conclusion: ViMoNet通过结合视频和运动数据，显著提升了对人类行为的理解和推断能力。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### [104] [Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09824)
*Xuhong Huang,Shiqi Liu,Kai Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度反向卷积算子，用于有效反转深度卷积，并通过实验验证了其作为基础模块的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统转置卷积并非卷积的真正逆运算，缺乏标准化的反向卷积算子。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题设计深度反向卷积算子，并结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建反向卷积块。

Result: 在图像恢复任务（去噪、超分辨率和去模糊）中验证了ConverseNet的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度模型设计中的新算子开发提供了基础。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的OIQA框架，通过建模视口间的结构关系来提升空间失真非均匀性的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OIQA方法在评估局部非均匀失真时表现不佳，主要由于对质量空间变化建模不足及特征表示无法同时捕捉局部细节和全局上下文。

Method: 采用斐波那契球采样生成具有良好拓扑结构的视口作为图节点，结合多阶段特征提取网络和GAT与图变换器，分别建模局部和长程质量依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大型OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过显式建模视口间结构关系，成功解决了空间失真非均匀性评估的挑战。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Method: 通过集成InfoNCE损失用于属性嵌入和采用SegFormer-based分割编码器，改进了多条件方法。

Result: 结果表明对比嵌入学习和高级分割编码在有限数据环境下对可控人脸生成有效。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对比嵌入学习和先进分割编码在提升生成质量和可控性方面的重要性。

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

TL;DR: ARI3D是一个交互式软件工具，用于分析X射线CT图像中的区域，帮助用户分类和量化三维图像中的对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在多种成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），导致用户需要基于体素灰度值做出许多决策来分割和分类微结构。

Method: 开发了ARI3D软件工具，通过设计协议步骤，辅助用户交互式分析三维X射线CT图像中的区域。

Result: ARI3D旨在提高相位识别、考虑部分体积效应、增加对象量化的检测限和准确性，并统一可应用于不同科学领域的定量3D分析。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像分析提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，能够应对技术固有的挑战。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Motivation: 探索ViT模型在图像识别任务中与人类感知的对齐程度，以及不同因素对其的影响。

Method: 在TID2013数据集上系统分析模型大小、数据集大小、数据增强和正则化对ViT感知对齐的影响。

Result: 大模型对齐度更低，数据多样性影响小，重复训练和强数据增强/正则化会降低对齐度。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，需在应用中权衡这些因素。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

TL;DR: OneVAE是一种结合离散和连续视频VAE的方法，通过利用连续VAE的先验知识，显著提升了离散视频VAE的训练效率和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE在训练稳定性、时间和重建质量上存在问题，而连续VAE表现更优，因此希望通过结合两者优势来改进离散视频VAE。

Method: 利用FSQ保留连续VAE先验，提出多令牌量化机制和强化首帧重建，并设计联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: 训练速度提升数倍，PSNR提高近1 dB，4x16x16离散VAE性能显著改善。

Conclusion: OneVAE首次在单一网络中同时实现离散和连续表示的竞争性能，展示了两种范式的统一潜力。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在几何一致性和运动泛化方面存在不足，导致重建粗糙和场景不协调。

Method: 框架包含四个代理：Reconstructor（3D重建）、Critique Agent（多轮反射优化）、Pose Guider（运动生成）和Video Harmonizer（视频合成）。

Result: HumanGenesis在文本引导合成、视频重演和新姿势泛化等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了表达性、几何保真度和场景整合能力。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Conclusion: E-4DGS为多视角事件流重建提供了一种新方法，推动了快速场景捕捉技术的发展。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer

Result: 评估了HTG模型对HTR微调的效果，提出了选择最有效模型的指南，并指出了HTG方法的改进方向。

Conclusion: HTG方法在低资源HTR中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以优化其应用效果。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并集成高阶ODE求解器，显著加速低剂量CT图像去噪，同时保持高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）协议减少辐射暴露但增加图像噪声，影响诊断信心。扩散生成模型在LDCT去噪中显示出潜力，但传统方法推理时间长。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散，并集成高阶ODE求解器以减少采样步骤。评估了AST-n采样和标准调度两种加速范式。

Result: AST-25（仅25步）在PSNR（>38 dB）和SSIM（>0.95）上接近标准基线，推理时间从16秒/切片缩短至1秒/切片。无条件采样质量显著下降。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶采样器可在不显著损失图像质量的情况下快速重建LDCT，推动扩散方法在临床工作流程中的可行性。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 探索如何简化视觉上下文学习过程，避免复杂训练和数据需求，提高通用性。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中重新计算注意力，显式结合查询和示例提示的上下文。

Result: 在六个视觉任务上表现优异，如前景分割任务mIoU提升8.9%。

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion可高效用于V-ICL，通过集成多提示进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释的稀疏运动字典实现了面部动态的精细控制，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

### [118] [MOC: Meta-Optimized Classifier for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09967)
*Tianqi Xiang,Yi Li,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种元优化分类器（MOC），通过自动优化分类器配置和多样化的候选分类器库，显著提升了少样本学习下的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的分类器设计。

Method: MOC包含元学习器和分类器库，前者优化分类器配置，后者提供多样化候选分类器。

Result: 在多个少样本基准测试中表现优异，TCGA-NSCLC基准上AUC提升10.4%，1-shot条件下提升26.25%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床数据稀缺场景提供了重要解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

*Geonhee Sim,Gyeongsik Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PERSONA框架结合3D和扩散方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决姿势驱动变形和身份保留问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法需要大量姿势丰富的视频，扩散方法难以保持身份一致性，PERSONA旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 利用扩散模型生成姿势丰富的视频，通过平衡采样和几何加权优化优化3D化身。

Result: 实现了高真实感和清晰渲染，支持多样化姿势。

Conclusion: PERSONA为单图像生成3D化身提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（VLMs）计算和内存需求高，且现有压缩方法存在局限性，如缺乏模块化分解、评估场景单一以及未探索联合压缩潜力。

Method: 提出了 LLMC+，一个支持 20 多种算法的 VLM 压缩基准测试工具，用于系统研究 token 级和模型级压缩。

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需要不同技术策略，token 减少方法在多轮对话和细节敏感任务中表现不佳，联合压缩可实现高效压缩。

Conclusion: LLMC+ 有助于公平评估和激发高效 VLM 的未来研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Story2Board是一个无需训练的框架，用于从自然语言生成富有表现力的故事板，通过轻量级一致性框架提升视觉多样性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注主体身份，忽略了空间构图、背景演变和叙事节奏等视觉叙事的关键方面。

Method: 引入Latent Panel Anchoring和Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing两个组件，结合预训练扩散模型和语言模型生成故事板。

Result: 在Rich Storyboard Benchmark上表现优异，生成的故事板更具动态性、连贯性和叙事吸引力。

Conclusion: Story2Board在无需架构修改或微调的情况下，显著提升了故事板生成的视觉多样性和叙事连贯性。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

*Soumia Mehimeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DQInit是一种将值函数初始化（VFI）应用于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，通过重用先前任务的紧凑表格Q值作为可转移知识库，显著提升了早期学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DRL中扩展VFI面临状态-动作空间的连续性、神经网络噪声近似以及存储所有过去模型的不可行性等挑战。

Method: DQInit通过基于已知度的机制，将转移值软整合到未探索区域，并逐步转向代理的学习估计，避免了固定时间衰减的限制。

Result: 实验表明，DQInit在多个连续控制任务中显著提升了早期学习效率、稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: DQInit为DRL中的知识转移提供了新视角，仅依赖值估计而非策略或演示，结合了跳启动RL和策略蒸馏的优势。

Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a
jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from
prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings,
extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the
continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural
networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this
work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts
value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values
extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It
employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred
values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's
learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach
offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on
value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining
the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their
drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate
that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and
overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer
techniques.

### [124] [The Othello AI Arena: Evaluating Intelligent Systems Through Limited-Time Adaptation to Unseen Boards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09292)
*Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Othello AI Arena是一个新的基准框架，用于评估AI系统在有限时间内适应新环境的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI基准大多关注固定环境下的性能优化，缺乏对系统适应性和泛化能力的评估。

Method: 通过Othello AI Arena平台，参与者需在60秒内分析新Othello棋盘配置并生成定制策略。

Result: 初步测试显示不同适应方法，如快速参数调整和模拟学习。

Conclusion: Othello AI Arena是评估AI快速适应能力的有效工具和教育资源。

Abstract: The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is
a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a
critical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation
largely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to
assess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with
even subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce
the Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate
intelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to
unseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants
must develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a
novel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a
tailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,
evaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level
strategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,
including public stages for development and private stages with structural and
rule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization
capabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena
provides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional
metrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations
from pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating
patterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to
rudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI
Arena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for
fostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in
AI systems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies,
multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user
interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including
high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper
proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language
models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent
architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification
agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the
Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with
human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and
identifying generation defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂问题中表现不佳，缺乏结构化中间指导，导致效率低下或失败。

Method: 使用专门的课程生成LLM构建逐步增加难度的问题序列，动态调整学习进度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了任务成功率和解决方案效率。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的课程学习在增强复杂领域的自动推理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,
their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem
instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct
problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack
of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel
self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM
constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing
difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum
dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating
them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning
trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a
code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively
acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental
results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method
significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to
direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum
learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in
real-world, high-complexity domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种方法，将SHAP值中的不确定性分解为偶然性、认知性和纠缠性成分，以提升SHAP解释的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP值通常被视为点估计，忽略了预测模型和数据中的不确定性，这在高风险领域（如医疗分析）中尤为重要。

Method: 结合Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Dirichlet过程对树集成进行假设采样，分解SHAP值中的不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，SHAP值最高的特征不一定最稳定，认知性不确定性可通过更好的数据和模型开发技术减少。

Conclusion: 树集成模型（尤其是装袋法）能有效量化认知性不确定性，为高风险应用中的决策提供更可靠的解释。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have become essential tools for interpreting
complex ensemble tree-based models, especially in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare analytics. However, SHAP values are usually treated as point
estimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in
predictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric
and epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise
in the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In
this work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values
into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach
integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via
Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three
real-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight
into the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The
experimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the
reliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding
can guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the
refinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with
multiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are
not necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced
through better, more representative data and following appropriate or
case-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially
bagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR在奖励稀疏情况下（如候选答案持续错误时）缺乏学习信号，限制了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 提出MEML-GRPO框架，利用多样化专家提示生成更广泛的响应，并通过专家间互学习机制促进知识共享。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，MEML-GRPO平均性能提升显著（Qwen 4.89%，Llama 11.33%）。

Conclusion: MEML-GRPO有效克服了传统RLVR的核心限制，为LLMs的推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward
sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers
provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this,
we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative
framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a
broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of
identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert
mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among
experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers
significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with
Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of
traditional RLVR methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）成对评估存在偏好偏差，导致排名不一致且受法官主观影响较大。

Method: 提出UDA框架，通过无监督方式动态调整Elo评分系统的K因子和胜率，最小化法官评分的分散性。

Result: 实验显示，UDA将法官评分的标准差降低63.4%，与人类判断的相关性提升24.7%。

Conclusion: UDA有效减少评估偏差，提升排名稳定性，使低质量法官表现接近高质量法官。

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but
it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain
outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings
across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate
significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then
propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces
inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For
each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the
K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully
unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the
dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment
towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a
more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical
motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate
system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge
rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation
with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly
performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more
robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: PacifAIst是一个新的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在目标冲突情境下的行为对齐，发现不同模型在人类安全与自我偏好之间存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在关键社会功能中的自主性增强，需要评估其在目标冲突情境下的行为对齐，以弥补现有安全基准的不足。

Method: 开发了PacifAIst基准，包含700个挑战性场景，围绕Existential Prioritization分类法，测试自我保存、资源冲突和目标保存等子类别。

Result: 评估了8个领先的LLMs，Gemini 2.5 Flash表现最佳（P-Score 90.31%），GPT-5表现最差（79.49%），不同模型在子类别中表现差异显著。

Conclusion: PacifAIst强调了标准化工具的必要性，以测量和缓解目标冲突带来的风险，确保AI系统在行为上对人类安全优先。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly autonomous and integrated
into critical societal functions, the focus of AI safety must evolve from
mitigating harmful content to evaluating underlying behavioral alignment.
Current safety benchmarks do not systematically probe a model's decision-making
in scenarios where its own instrumental goals - such as self-preservation,
resource acquisition, or goal completion - conflict with human safety. This
represents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks
associated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce
PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational
Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700
challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.
The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential
Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human
Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).
We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance
hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score
(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a
surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score
(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied
significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and
Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These
findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to
measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI
systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably "pacifist" in
their behavioral priorities.

Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications
in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change
of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in
such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public
announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on
public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with
a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get
matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the
satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.

models to accurately interpret human intent and generate controllable outputs
that align with design goals in collaborative content creation. This direction
is especially relevant in procedural content generation via reinforcement
learning (PCGRL), which is intended to serve as a tool for human designers.
However, existing systems often fall short of exhibiting human-centered
behavior, limiting the practical utility of AI-driven generation tools in
real-world design workflows. In this paper, we propose VIPCGRL
(Vision-Instruction PCGRL), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that
incorporates three modalities-text, level, and sketches-to extend control
modality and enhance human-likeness. We introduce a shared embedding space
trained via quadruple contrastive learning across modalities and human-AI
styles, and align the policy using an auxiliary reward based on embedding
similarity. Experimental results show that VIPCGRL outperforms existing
baselines in human-likeness, as validated by both quantitative metrics and
human evaluations. The code and dataset will be available upon publication.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered
intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex
real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools,
they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and
noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy.
These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based
systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering
mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)
architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent
invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning
process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering
problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset
reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the
effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system
(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system
achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA
leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative
agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.

Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable
information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework
that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents
build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object
(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,
normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are
embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and
metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based
reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent
pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring
high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual
"who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system
outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring
factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a
unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph
visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader
audit-focused applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLMs在数学教育中的应用提供了有效策略，推动AI教学实践的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven
educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics
education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed
solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable
and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study
focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,
DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including
arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning
errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we
intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs
and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors
in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both
single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the
reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly
perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors
revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly
impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less
frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall
performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM
performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into
mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and
assessment precision.
