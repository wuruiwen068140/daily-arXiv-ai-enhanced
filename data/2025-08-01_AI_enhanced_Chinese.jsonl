In this paper, we study\nthe complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of\nontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced\nfamily of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of\nweighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the\ndatabase setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data\ncomplexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are\nfirst-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes \"shP\"-hard when the\nontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\\exists R.\nA \\sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next\nexplore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that\nintractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language\nsupports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive\nqueries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields\npositive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we\nidentify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which\nintuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit\ntractable WSMS computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08WSMS\uff09\u5728ontology-mediated\u67e5\u8be2\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ontology-mediated\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790WSMS\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8efirst-order-rewritable\u67e5\u8be2\uff0cWSMS\u5177\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u672c\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u4e3ashP-hard\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u5728DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\u4e2d\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "WSMS\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses.
