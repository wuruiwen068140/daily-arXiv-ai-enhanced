However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

To spur the\ndevelopment of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long\nhorizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of\ninteractive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human\nplayers over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve\nas an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The\nbenchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for\nself-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby\nfocusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory\nenvironment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and\nsustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release\nTextQuests at https://textquests.ai."}

Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean\nprovide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective\ntraining through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose\n\\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover\ncan iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and\nself-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three\ntest-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.\nSeed-Prover proves $78.1\\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,\nand achieves over 50\\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in\nLean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \\textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which\noutperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to\nparticipate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work\nrepresents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long\nchain-of-thought reasoning."}

Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce\nSimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based\non a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \\modelname\novercomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world\nmodel for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented\nusing LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the\nconcept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web\nbrowsing tasks show that \\modelname improves the success of flight search from\n0\\% to 32.2\\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent\nadvantage of up to 124\\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the\nadvantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited\nabout the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs\nthat can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,\na web-browsing agent built on \\modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a\nresearch demo for public testing."}
