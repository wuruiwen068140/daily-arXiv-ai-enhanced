### [1] [Privacy Enhancement for Gaze Data Using a Noise-Infused Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10918)
*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在噪声自编码器的隐私增强机制，用于保护视线信号数据，防止用户在未经同意的情况下被重新识别，同时保留数据的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视线数据在生物识别和预测任务中具有重要价值，但也存在隐私泄露的风险。现有方法在保护隐私的同时可能牺牲数据的实用性或生理合理性。

Method: 采用潜在噪声自编码器，通过生成生理合理的视线模式，平衡隐私保护和数据实用性。

Result: 显著降低了生物识别的可识别性，同时对数据的实用性影响最小，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据提供了有效的隐私保护方案，同时保持了数据的可用性和生理合理性。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

### [2] [A Survey on Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10922)
*Jianlong Wu,Wei Liu,Ye Liu,Meng Liu,Liqiang Nie,Zhouchen Lin,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 综述探讨了基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频时序定位（VTG）研究，填补了该领域全面调研的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注通用视频-语言理解，缺乏对VTG-MLLMs的专门综述。

Method: 通过三维分类法（功能角色、训练范式、视频特征处理）系统分析当前研究。

Result: 总结了基准数据集、评估协议及实证结果，并指出局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，并提供了资源库链接。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By \underline{V}alue \underline{S}ign \underline{F}lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负提示引导上存在不足，VSF旨在更高效地抑制不需要的内容。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号动态抑制内容，计算开销小，兼容多种模型架构。

Result: 实验表明VSF在少步模型中显著优于现有方法，且在非少步模型中也能与CFG竞争。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且兼容性强的负提示引导方法，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in
https://github.com/weathon/VSF/tree/main.

### [4] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于提升单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。现有APR方法虽有效，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法通常更准确。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用PAE-based RPR优化APR预测，无需额外数据存储。

Result: 实验表明，PAE-based RPR优于等效架构的图像RPR模型，且在仅30%数据训练下仍保持竞争力，显著减少零售部署的数据收集负担。

Conclusion: PAE-based RPR能有效提升APR定位精度，适用于数据有限的零售场景。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

### [5] [ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934)
*Jiahui Huang,Qunjie Zhou,Hesam Rabeti,Aleksandr Korovko,Huan Ling,Xuanchi Ren,Tianchang Shen,Jun Gao,Dmitry Slepichev,Chen-Hsuan Lin,Jiawei Ren,Kevin Xie,Joydeep Biswas,Laura Leal-Taixe,Sanja Fidler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，性能优于现有基线，并开源了大规模标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从野外视频中获取一致且精确的3D注释的挑战，以支持空间AI系统的发展。

Method: ViPE通过估计相机内参、相机运动和密集近度量深度图来处理多样化视频场景，支持多种相机模型。

Result: 在TUM/KITTI序列上性能提升18%/50%，运行速度为3-5FPS，并标注了包含约96M帧的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其开源数据集有望加速空间AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

### [6] [HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10935)
*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-OV3D框架通过跨模态几何一致性和基于DDIM的去噪机制，显著提升了开放词汇3D检测中伪标签的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测框架无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法在几何质量（如边界框精度）上存在不足。

Method: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，包含IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用跨模态几何一致性和标注类几何先验优化伪标签。

Result: 在新型类别上mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或高质量伪标签生成器，适用于开放词汇检测或标注流程。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

### [7] [Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936)
*Cheng Chen,Hao Huang,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占据预测方法，显著提升了性能并降低了通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集3D体素或2D平面特征，通信成本高或需要额外监督，限制了协作场景的适用性。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码，以及稀疏对象中心消息传递。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别比单代理和基线协作方法提升显著，且在低通信量下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中表现出色，适用于通信资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

### [8] [Personalized Face Super-Resolution with Identity Decoupling and Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10937)
*Jiarui Yang,Hang Guo,Wen Huang,Tao Dai,Shutao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IDFSR方法，通过身份解耦和拟合提升极端退化场景下的面部超分辨率效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端退化场景（如8倍以上缩放）下难以恢复真实且身份一致的面部图像，容易产生幻觉效果。

Method: 采用掩码、变形参考图像和身份嵌入三项关键设计，预训练扩散模型解耦风格与身份，并微调身份嵌入。

Result: IDFSR在极端退化场景下显著优于现有方法，尤其在身份一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合有效解决了极端退化场景下的面部超分辨率问题。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

### [9] [ORBIT: An Object Property Reasoning Benchmark for Visual Inference Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10956)
*Abhishek Kolari,Mohammadhossein Khojasteh,Yifan Jiang,Floris den Hengst,Filip Ilievski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在对象属性推理上的能力，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答（VQA）基准测试在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏多样性和复杂性，无法全面评估VLMs的能力。

Method: 通过设计包含三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四个对象属性维度的系统评估框架，构建了ORBIT基准测试，包含360张图像和1,080个计数问题。

Result: 在零样本设置下测试12种先进VLMs，发现其表现显著低于人类，最佳模型准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了VLMs在对象属性推理上的不足，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试方法和更强大的推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统木材分类方法耗时且依赖专家知识，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 构建自定义图像数据集，评估五种CNN架构。

Result: ShuffleNetV2平均准确率99.29%，F1分数99.35%。

Conclusion: 轻量级深度学习模型适用于资源受限环境的高精度木材分类。

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

### [11] [Not There Yet: Evaluating Vision Language Models in Simulating the Visual Perception of People with Low Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10972)
*Rosiana Natalie,Wenqian Xu,Ruei-Che Chang,Rada Mihalcea,Anhong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在模拟低视力个体视觉感知方面的能力，发现结合视觉信息和示例图像响应能显著提高模拟准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，特别是低视力个体的视觉感知。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者收集数据，构建VLM模拟代理，评估其与参与者原始回答的一致性。

Result: VLMs在仅提供视觉信息或示例图像响应时一致性较低（0.59），结合两者后显著提高（0.70）。

Conclusion: 结合视觉信息和示例图像响应能有效提升VLMs模拟低视力个体视觉感知的准确性。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Conclusion: NIRMAL Pooling在图像识别任务中表现出色，是一种灵活可靠的池化方法替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

### [13] [A Cross-Modal Rumor Detection Scheme via Contrastive Learning by Exploring Text and Image internal Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11141)
*Bin Ma,Yifei Zhang,Yongjin Xian,Qi Li,Linna Zhou,Gongxun Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的多尺度图像与上下文相关性探索算法（MICC），通过跨模态多尺度对齐和自适应权重融合，显著提升了谣言检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谣言检测方法常忽略图像内容及不同视觉尺度下上下文与图像的关系，导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 设计了SCLIP编码器生成统一语义嵌入，引入跨模态多尺度对齐模块和尺度感知融合网络。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC算法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

### [14] [Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942)
*Liming Xu,Dave Towey,Andrew P. French,Steve Benford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何检测Artcodes（一种伪装成自由形态的装饰性标记），提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图）来识别其拓扑结构，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中可能出现更多与虚拟元素连接的物体。检测这些物体的存在是触发后续交互的第一步。Artcodes作为一种兼具人类可读性和机器可读性的标记，其拓扑结构的识别是一个独特的计算机视觉问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的特征描述符——形状方向直方图，用于描述Artcode的通用拓扑结构。通过收集数据集并进行实验，评估了基于该特征向量的Artcode检测系统的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的特征向量能够有效表示拓扑结构，且系统在检测Artcode方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 尽管这是首次尝试开发基于特征的拓扑物体检测系统，但该研究为拓扑物体检测的应用和交互机会开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉内容评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键评估指标的关注。

Method: 通过约束模型输出为整数标签，并采用目标掩码策略，仅关注标签的前两位数计算损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，并在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签微调在定量评估场景中优化视觉语言模型的有效性得到了验证。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于低分辨率CT的框架，用于量化干纺织增强材料在压实过程中的嵌套行为，并通过3D-UNet和两点相关函数分析几何特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解纺织增强复合材料的多尺度结构对预测其力学性能至关重要，嵌套行为直接影响刚度、渗透性和损伤容限。

Method: 采用低分辨率CT进行原位压实实验，使用3D-UNet进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型在分割任务中表现优异（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），结果与显微图像验证一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为逆向建模和结构分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

TL;DR: DeCLIP通过解耦CLIP的自注意力模块，分别提取“内容”和“上下文”特征，并结合视觉基础模型和扩散模型增强特征，显著提升了开放词汇密集感知任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集视觉感知任务受限于预定义类别，而CLIP等视觉语言模型在开放词汇任务中表现不佳，主要因为局部特征表示不足。

Method: 提出DeCLIP框架，解耦自注意力模块，分别优化内容和上下文特征，利用视觉基础模型和扩散模型增强特征。

Result: DeCLIP在多种任务（如2D检测、3D实例分割等）中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知任务提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLM）在图像和文本对齐中可能隐含的性别偏见，通过分析人脸照片与职业描述短语的嵌入相似性，揭示了模型中的性别关联模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在共享表示空间中对齐图像和文本，但这种对齐可能隐含社会刻板印象，尤其是性别偏见。本研究旨在量化这种偏见。

Method: 研究者构建了一个包含220张人脸照片和150条职业描述短语的数据集，通过计算嵌入相似性得分，并结合自举法和标签交换零模型，评估性别关联。

Result: 研究揭示了视觉语言模型中性别与职业描述之间的关联模式，并提供了量化偏见的框架和不确定性分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为视觉语言模型中的性别偏见提供了评估方法，揭示了模型可能隐含的社会刻板印象。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成挑战，尤其在计算机视觉任务中。

Method: 提出增量补丁生成（IPG）方法，通过实验和消融研究验证其有效性。

Result: IPG生成的补丁能广泛覆盖模型漏洞，并可作为构建鲁棒模型的知识基础。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用中具有潜力，如自动驾驶和安全系统。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: PMTFR框架通过Pyramid Patcher模块和多粒度视觉理解，结合训练免费的精炼方法，在监督CIR任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在CIR任务中需要额外训练排序模型，且CoT技术应用受限，难以在监督CIR中取得满意结果。

Method: 提出PMTFR框架，包括Pyramid Matching Model和Training-Free Refinement，通过Pyramid Patcher增强多粒度视觉理解，并利用CoT数据表示提升性能。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR通过简单有效的模块和训练免费的精炼方法，显著提升了监督CIR任务的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Motivation: 现有医学多模态基准通常局限于单图像、单轮任务，无法捕捉临床实践中的纵向和多模态交互特性。

Method: MedAtlas框架支持四种核心任务，包括开放式和封闭式多轮问答、多图像联合推理和综合疾病诊断，结合了多模态图像和临床文本的时序交互。

Result: 基准测试显示现有多模态模型在多阶段临床推理中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健且可信赖的医学AI提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

Motivation: 探索RETFound模型在视盘分割任务中的潜力，验证基础模型在特定任务中的替代性。

Method: 通过微调RETFound模型的头部，利用少量任务特定样本进行训练。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上达到约96%的Dice分数，表现优于现有分割专用网络。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现卓越，支持基础模型作为任务特定架构的替代方案。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net 有望加速临床神经科学研究，增强临床对深度学习方法的信任，并推动其在扩散 MRI 分析中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

Result: SRL在管状数据集上的表现未优于传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

Conclusion: G-CUT3R能有效利用先验信息，同时兼容不同输入模态。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

Conclusion: 该方法为ADAS和自动驾驶提供了更鲁棒的感知输入，有助于提升道路安全。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

Motivation: 解决历史手写文本识别中因稀缺转录、语言变异和多样书写风格导致的数字化难题。

Method: 采用TrOCR模型，结合针对性图像预处理和四种新型数据增强方法，并评估集成学习策略。

Result: 最佳单模型增强（Elastic）的字符错误率（CER）为1.86，集成方法进一步降至1.60，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 领域特定的数据增强和集成策略对提升历史手稿识别性能具有重要影响。

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

### [31] [EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10963)
*Zixiang Yang,Yue Ma,Yinhan Zhang,Shanhui Mo,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVCtrl是一种轻量级、即插即用的控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，显著提升图像和视频生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet在提供精确时空控制的同时，引入了大量冗余计算，尤其是在视频生成中，导致延迟增加。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略：空间上分区网络为全局和局部功能区域，局部感知缓存聚焦于需要控制信号的区域；时间上选择性跳过不必要的去噪步骤。

Result: 在CogVideo-Controlnet和Wan2.1-Controlnet上分别实现了2.16和2.05倍的加速，生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: EVCtrl无需重新训练模型即可高效实现图像和视频的精确控制生成。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过奖励引导解码来适应多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，以提升其视觉定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，需要适应多样化的用户需求，尤其是提升视觉定位能力。

Method: 构建了两个独立的奖励模型，分别控制对象精确度和召回率，并通过动态调整奖励函数的重要性和搜索广度来实现对MLLM推理过程的控制。

Result: 在标准对象幻觉基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有幻觉缓解方法，并提供了对MLLM推理的高度可控性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了MLLMs的视觉定位能力，还实现了对推理过程的动态控制，满足了多样化的用户需求。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5和GPT-4o在乳腺X光视觉问答任务中的表现，探索通用大语言模型在临床影像应用中的潜力。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上测试BI-RADS评估、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在各项任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光筛查任务中表现有潜力，但需领域适配和优化才能用于高风险的临床影像应用。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Motivation: 当前缺乏开放数据集来全面评估和微调VLMs在建筑安全检查中的应用，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含图像标注、安全规则违反视觉问答（VQA）和建筑元素视觉定位任务的数据集，并评估现有VLMs的零样本和少样本表现。

Result: 现有VLMs在零样本和少样本设置下表现出显著的泛化能力，但需进一步训练以适应实际工地场景。

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k为研究者提供了训练和评估VLMs的基准，推动了建筑安全检查领域的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Motivation: 文档欺诈对依赖安全文档的行业构成威胁，需要有效的检测机制。

Method: 通过提示优化和模型推理过程分析，评估多模态大语言模型在识别欺诈指标（如篡改文本、格式不一致等）上的能力。

Result: 表现最佳的多模态大语言模型在零样本泛化上优于传统方法，但部分视觉大语言模型表现不一致或较差。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在文档欺诈检测中具有潜力，但需任务特定微调，为未来可解释和可扩展的欺诈缓解策略奠定基础。

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedSAMix是一种无需训练的方法，通过整合通用模型（如SAM）和专用模型（如MedSAM）的优势，提升医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在数据异质性、标注稀缺和分布偏移等问题下泛化能力受限，需要一种更有效的方法来结合通用和专用模型的优势。

Method: 提出一种零阶优化方法，自动发现最优的逐层合并方案，并通过单任务优化和多目标优化两种策略满足不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务中，MedSAMix显著提升了性能，在专用任务和多任务评估中分别提高了6.67%和4.37%。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过自动优化合并策略，有效提升了医学图像分割的领域特异性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

TL;DR: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign数据集解决了现有3D视觉语言数据集的局限性，通过多视角推理和丰富的多对象对齐信号，提升了3D场景理解能力。LEGO方法在预训练后表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D VL数据集缺乏多视角推理和丰富的上下文对齐，限制了模型对远距离对象的深度理解。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集测试多视角推理，TripAlign数据集提供2D-3D-语言预训练语料，并开发LEGO方法进行知识迁移。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign推动了3D VL学习的发展，LEGO方法展示了多视角推理的潜力。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖人群中糖尿病的存在与否差异表明，详细的身体组成可能揭示腹部表型与糖尿病的关系。

Method: 研究通过AI分析临床CT影像，将腹部扫描转化为可解释的测量数据，使用随机森林模型和SHAP分析识别糖尿病风险特征，并在不同BMI亚组中验证。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、年龄、内脏和皮下脂肪增加以及胰腺较小或脂肪含量高是各组的共同糖尿病特征。

Conclusion: 腹部特征对2型糖尿病的驱动作用在不同体重组中可能一致。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 分层生成和语义部分信息的结合是提升3D内容生成的关键。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅关注去雾，缺乏雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换能力。

Method: 设计了双马尔可夫链以平滑双向转换，通过扰动图像和预测噪声学习条件分布，并引入统一评分函数降低计算成本。

Result: RBDM仅需15步采样即可实现尺寸无关的双向转换，在合成和真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: RBDM成功解决了双向转换问题，性能优越且计算高效。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive

sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the

Motivation: 现有去雾方法在处理真实世界厚雾场景时效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏真实世界的配对数据和鲁棒先验。

Method: 采用两阶段学习方案：第一阶段使用EM算法解耦配对图像的联合分布，并用统一的布朗桥扩散模型建模；第二阶段利用预训练模型和大规模未配对数据进一步提升性能。此外，引入细节增强的残差差分卷积块（RDC）捕捉梯度级信息。

Conclusion: EM-B3DM通过半监督学习和两阶段方案，显著提升了真实世界雾霾图像的去雾效果，且无需依赖大量配对数据。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现实遥感场景中，源域数据常因隐私和传输限制无法获取，导致传统无监督域适应方法受限。SFOD虽无需源数据，但易因伪标签噪声导致训练崩溃。

Method: VG-DETR结合视觉基础模型（VFM），利用少量目标域标注数据减少伪标签噪声，并通过VFM引导的伪标签挖掘和双级对齐方法增强特征表示。

Result: 实验表明，VG-DETR在无源遥感检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过整合VFM和半监督学习，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了跨域检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Motivation: 连续类别发现（CCD）面临无标签数据中新类别的自动发现、避免灾难性遗忘以及减少错误积累的挑战。现有方法难以平衡新类别发现与分类的矛盾，且存储开销大。

Method: IDOD方法包括独立多样性模块（使用对比损失训练骨干网络）、联合发现模块（将多阶段新类别发现转化为单阶段）和正交性模块（生成正交原型并减少存储开销）。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: IDOD方法有效解决了CCD中的矛盾问题，减少了错误积累，并降低了存储开销，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有适配器方法在视觉和文本表示对齐时仅依赖显式空间邻近性，无法捕捉类别与图像样本之间的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: LatHAdapter引入可学习的属性提示作为桥梁，在双曲空间中投影类别、属性和图像，并通过层次正则化学习潜在语义层次结构。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上的实验表明，LatHAdapter在已知类别适应和未知类别泛化方面均优于其他微调方法。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过利用潜在语义层次结构，显著提升了少样本分类任务的性能，尤其在处理复杂关联和未知类别时表现突出。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法在空间和时间上缺乏灵活性，GVT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GVT使用2D高斯生成策略和时空高斯嵌入机制，分离静态和动态内容。

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GVT在视频处理任务中展现了高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: CHARM3R通过优化深度估计方法，显著提升了单目3D检测器在相机高度变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car

we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable
device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset
through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

TL;DR: UAV-VL-R1是一种轻量级视觉语言模型，专为无人机航拍图像设计，通过混合训练方法提升推理能力，并在资源受限平台上实现实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂空间语义和实时性要求，限制了其在结构化航拍推理任务中的应用。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和多阶段强化学习（RL）的混合方法，结合GRPO算法，通过规则引导奖励和组内策略对齐提升推理能力。

Result: UAV-VL-R1在零样本任务中比基线模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct准确率高48.17%，甚至优于其36倍大的72B变体，且内存占用低。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1通过GRPO增强逻辑灵活性，弥补SFT在数学任务中的多样性不足，同时支持资源受限平台的实时部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Method: 两阶段知识蒸馏：第一阶段引入关节结构损失挖掘语义信息；第二阶段使用IGP-GCN渐进式优化姿态。

Result: 在COCO和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了轻量级姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中，多模态输入（如RGB、红外等）的不确定性或缺失对传统行人重识别方法提出了挑战，需要一种轻量且高效的解决方案。

Method: UMM框架包含多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态线索交互学习器，结合CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力，实现高效多模态融合。

Result: 实验表明，UMM在不确定模态条件下表现出强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶场景中的行人重识别提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在多维度偏好对齐上表现出色，为音频驱动肖像动画提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

TL;DR: SAEs are evaluated for vision models, showing semantic meaning, improved generalization, and controllable generation across various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs are popular for interpreting LLMs but understudied in vision models, prompting an evaluation of their potential in the visual domain.

Method: Extensive evaluation of SAEs on vision models, including embedding models, multi-modal LLMs, and diffusion models, using diverse image-based tasks.

Result: SAE features are semantically meaningful, enhance out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation, revealing shared representations in multi-modal LLMs.

Conclusion: SAEs show strong potential for improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in vision models, laying a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了单目内窥镜重建的挑战，为手术导航提供了更准确的3D组织表面重建。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness

TL;DR: TimeMachine是一种基于扩散模型的框架，用于精确编辑面部年龄同时保持身份特征不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型在面部图像编辑方面取得进展，但细粒度年龄编辑且保持身份特征仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过多交叉注意力模块注入高精度年龄信息，分离年龄和身份特征，并提出Age Classifier Guidance模块在潜在空间预测年龄。

Result: 实验表明TimeMachine在细粒度年龄编辑和身份一致性保持上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TimeMachine通过新颖设计和高质量数据集HFFA，实现了精确可控的面部年龄编辑。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了高光谱成像（HSI）在行人分割中的潜力，通过对比RGB和两种降维方法（PCA和CSNR-JMIM），证明CSNR-JMIM在性能上优于RGB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RGB成像中的同色异谱现象，行人与背景难以区分，导致汽车感知系统的安全性问题。

Method: 使用H-City数据集，将128通道HSI数据转换为三通道表示（PCA和CSNR-JMIM），并评估了三种语义分割模型（U-Net、DeepLabV3+和SegFormer）。

Result: CSNR-JMIM在行人分割中平均IoU和F1分数分别提高了1.44%和2.18%，骑行者分割也有类似提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化HSI波段选择，可以有效提升行人分割性能，对汽车安全应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去噪后检索的范式（DRNet），通过过滤文本无关视频片段提升视频时刻检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法编码所有视频片段（包括无关片段），破坏了多模态对齐并阻碍优化。

Method: 提出DRNet，包含文本条件去噪（TCD）和文本重构反馈（TRF）模块，动态识别噪声片段并纯化多模态表示。

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪后检索范式可提升视频时刻检索性能，并适配其他先进模型。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

TL;DR: LogicBench和LogicCLIP旨在提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）的逻辑理解能力，填补其在逻辑推理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在逻辑理解方面存在显著不足，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出LogicBench作为基准测试，并开发LogicCLIP框架，通过逻辑感知数据生成和对比学习策略提升模型的逻辑敏感性。

Result: LogicCLIP在逻辑理解任务中显著优于基线模型，同时在通用视觉语言任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLMs的逻辑能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于单个物体运动建模的方法在拥挤场景或检测不准确时表现不佳，忽视了物体间的几何关系。现有几何感知方法易受无关物体干扰，导致特征模糊和错误关联。

Method: 设计了基于点对特征（PPF）的统一时空编码器，学习区分性轨迹嵌入；引入线索一致性变换模块对齐历史轨迹与当前检测的特征；动态更新机制保留关键时空信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上验证了方法的有效性，nuScenes验证集和测试集的AMOTA分别达到73.2%和70.3%。

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过动态场景线索一致性显著提升了3D多目标跟踪的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NoOp的噪声优化方法，通过学习匹配噪声来解决扩散分类器（DC）中的噪声不稳定性问题，从而提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散分类器（DC）存在噪声不稳定性问题，不同随机采样的噪声会导致性能显著变化，而现有方法通过集成大量噪声结果来稳定性能，但会降低分类速度。

Method: 提出NoOp方法，通过频率匹配和空间匹配原则优化噪声：1）优化数据集特定的参数化噪声；2）训练元网络生成图像特定的噪声偏移。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NoOp能够有效缓解噪声不稳定性问题。

Conclusion: NoOp通过学习匹配噪声，显著提升了扩散分类器的稳定性和分类速度。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决人脸识别系统中的偏见问题，通过合成数据来量化并减少偏见。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3和扩散模型，生成10,000张平衡的人脸图像，并在ArcFace、CosFace和AdaFace上进行基准测试。

Result: AdaFace减少了60%的组间TPR差异，光照因素占剩余偏见的42%。合成数据在跨数据集评估中表现良好（r=0.85）。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了可重复的标准，尽管计算开销较高，但能生成更多属性条件变体。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IAQD的新蒸馏方法，用于解决基于Transformer的增量目标检测中的知识遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于Transformer的增量目标检测中，传统的知识蒸馏方法（如匈牙利匹配）可能导致知识遗忘，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保留旧类别的知识。

Method: 提出Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD)，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 在代表性基准测试中，IAQD有效减少了知识遗忘，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种有效的蒸馏方法，能够在增量目标检测中保留旧类别的知识，同时不影响新类别的学习。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和推理监督，显著提升了HOI检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Result: 在SSIM上提升9%，推理速度提高四倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RMFAT适合实时大气湍流抑制任务，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance

Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use
extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly

computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

*Jingyu Li,Bozhou Zhang,Xin Jin,Jiankang Deng,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImagiDrive整合视觉语言模型（VLM）和驾驶世界模型（DWM），通过统一的想象-规划循环提升自动驾驶的预测和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要结合多模态上下文理解和精确的未来场景预测，但现有方法（VLM和DWM）各自独立，缺乏互补性。

Method: 提出ImagiDrive框架，将VLM的驾驶代理与DWM的场景想象器结合，通过迭代优化规划决策。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上验证了ImagiDrive的优越性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，实现了高效的自动驾驶预测与规划。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Motivation: 理解物体移除后残留的语义信息对于隐私保护和可编辑场景表示至关重要。

Method: 引入了一个新的基准和评估框架，通过实验在多种室内外场景中测量语义残留，并发布了Remove360数据集。

Result: 实验表明，当前方法在视觉几何缺失的情况下仍能保留语义信息，但存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前3D物体移除技术在真实场景中仍有不足，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

Result: 实验表明，MM-R1能以零样本方式生成高保真和强文本对齐的个性化图像。

Conclusion: MM-R1成功解锁了统一MLLMs在个性化图像生成中的潜力，无需针对每个新主题进行微调。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，临床实用性低；少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构。

Method: CoFi先通过少量标注图像生成粗分割掩码，再利用形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，引导SAM细化分割。

Result: Dice系数74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，标注和计算负担低。

Conclusion: CoFi适合研究和临床应用，具有高效和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

Motivation: 当前多镜头视频生成的研究仍处于初级阶段，生成的视频通常局限于单镜头序列，过渡效果不稳定。

Method: 构建Cine250K数据集，分析视频扩散模型中的注意力图与镜头边界的关系，设计掩码控制机制，并在训练中应用。

Result: CineTrans能够生成具有电影风格过渡的多镜头视频，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CineTrans通过创新的掩码控制机制和数据集，有效解决了多镜头视频生成的过渡问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this

Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过简单有效的设计，充分释放规划导向端到端方法的潜力，实现更准确可靠的驾驶行为。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HGFE轻量且可端到端训练，能显著提升识别性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进模型使用真实特征，提升泛化能力和人类对齐的可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

Motivation: 现有高效跟踪器因计算复杂度和参数减少导致特征表示能力不足，限制了其在复杂环境中的准确性。

Method: MST采用多状态生成（MSG）、状态特定增强（SSE）和跨状态交互（CSI）模块，通过轻量级设计增强特征表示。

Result: MST在多个数据集上表现优异，计算开销仅0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数，GOT-10K数据集上AO分数提升4.5%。

Conclusion: MST通过高效设计显著提升了跟踪性能，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Result: 在CPU条件下（8线程），10个训练周期内测试集分类准确率达89.10%，损失值稳定收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境下有效提升医学图像分类性能，为模型部署和推广提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

TL;DR: Veason-R1是一种专用于视频推理分割的LVLM，通过GRPO和CoT训练实现高性能分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在推理时解释性差和时空推理不足的问题。

Method: 使用GRPO和CoT初始化训练模型，结合视频级语义和帧级空间定位。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Veason-R1在视频推理分割中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和高性能。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中数据稀缺问题突出，现有异常生成方法缺乏保真度或需额外训练数据。

Method: 提出AAG框架，利用Stable Diffusion生成异常图像，引入交叉注意力增强（CAE）和自注意力增强（SAE）机制。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像能提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AAG是一种无需训练的高保真异常生成方法，适用于工业异常检测场景。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Motivation: 体育分析领域存在数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足等问题，TrajSV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TrajSV包括数据预处理、CRNet（轨迹增强的Transformer模块）和VRNet（编码器-解码器架构），并通过三重对比损失优化表示。

Result: 在三种体育视频数据集上，TrajSV在视频检索中提升近70%，动作识别中17类中9类领先，视频字幕提升近20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV在体育视频分析中表现出色，并提供了实际部署系统。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

Motivation: 探索视频语言模型中时间理解的机制，尤其是位置编码的作用。

Method: 通过移除或修改PEs、反转帧序列等实验，分析时间信息的整合路径。

Result: 发现时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成，并提出两种效率优化策略。

Conclusion: 时间理解依赖于帧间注意力，未来模型改进可基于此机制。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不实时，需要一种快速、经济的替代方案。

Method: 结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频中提取空间和结构数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了实时、低成本且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

Motivation: 现有方法在多视图信息交换上缺乏显式控制，导致编辑不一致和细节模糊。

Result: 实验表明CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰。

Conclusion: CoreEditor显著优于现有方法，提供了更灵活的用户控制。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放环境中难以有效组合多个LoRA适配器，尤其是在所需技能的数量和性质未知的情况下。

Method: LoRAtorio在潜在空间中划分空间块，计算每个块的预测噪声与基础模型的余弦相似度，构建空间感知权重矩阵，并加权聚合LoRA输出。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio通过动态模块选择和空间感知权重矩阵，实现了多LoRA组合的最先进性能，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme在感知和复杂推理任务中表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码生成和执行，成功超越了现有“图像思维”方法，为多模态推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Result: 通过原型实现的实证评估展示了方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的智能基础化程序有效管理基础化规模，同时保持推理正确性。

Abstract: ASPIC+ is one of the main general frameworks for rule-based argumentation for
AI. Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most
existing approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support
propositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a
preliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an
exponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures
are needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.
Therefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of
the grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning
process. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a
Datalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to
perform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose
simplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules
that have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an
empirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability.

Conclusion: 该研究将算法补救从个体推荐扩展到系统级设计，为社会福利提升提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Decision makers are increasingly relying on machine learning in sensitive
situations. In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals
with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven
decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual
(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world
applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing
outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the
inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact
and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel
framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple
recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction
as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided
by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse
costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap
between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a
three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal
capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware
optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.
Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that
our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve
near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work
extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level
design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while
maintaining individual actionability.

Method: 结合L2O逆优化器和PPO框架，利用Transformer处理长上下文，预测更新步骤并自动调整目标参数。

Result: 相比L-BFGSB，逆优化器效率提升36.41%，有效性提升22.97%；生成的计划在2.55小时内质量优于或媲美人工计划。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且临床可行，为质子PBS治疗计划提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers involves numerous conflicting
objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and
satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this,
experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally
expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts
have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most
time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on
theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and
integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to
automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning
time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by
learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we
integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed
for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability
issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop
virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy
network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The
inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based
on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in
this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves
the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In
conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our
framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR
sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription
dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with
human-generated plans.

Conclusion: 强和弱可接受性在非平坦ABA中具有研究价值，但需进一步解决其缺陷。

Abstract: In this work, we broaden the investigation of admissibility notions in the
context of assumption-based argumentation (ABA). More specifically, we study
two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from
abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the
respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes
called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation
frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the
relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general
non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been
recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions
cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated
for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate
desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak
admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the
central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak
admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in
non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics
and discuss ways to address these.

Result: LRMs无法主动询问信息，且表现出过度思考和幻觉行为。监督微调在此能力学习上具有潜力但面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为开发真正智能的LRMs提供了新视角，强调需超越单纯问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on
well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical
gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a
math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems
lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users'
requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types
of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our
systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking
for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking
and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of
supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new
insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving
problems.

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities
and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs.
However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of
entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several
continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to
efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining
learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world
scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of
updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In
this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for
CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on
the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic
Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of
learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently
outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,
1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with
methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal
performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive
embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 验证了RL与课程学习结合在GUI任务中的有效性。

Abstract: As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with
graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task
execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement
Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic
interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:
(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI
tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the
agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse
task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a
uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these
limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the
varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy
optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based
signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced
feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,
outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on
our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically
validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with
curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development
of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations
processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core
elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent
in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the
decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely
unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to
effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications
of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a
novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents
in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of
inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs
typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those
observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the
pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and
implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for
careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory
decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for
mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support
systems for supply chains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用概率地标（probabilistic landmarks）来改进UCT算法在随机规划中的性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地标在经典规划中已有显著贡献，但在随机领域应用较少。本文旨在探索地标在随机规划中的潜力。

Method: 通过形式化概率地标，并调整UCT算法以地标为子目标分解MDP，核心在于平衡贪婪地标达成与最终目标达成。

Result: 实验表明，合适的地标能显著提升UCT在在线概率规划中的性能，但最佳平衡点因问题而异。

Conclusion: 地标可以为解决MDP的随时算法提供有效指导。

Abstract: Landmarks$\unicode{x2013}$conditions that must be satisfied at some point in
every solution plan$\unicode{x2013}$have contributed to major advancements in
classical planning, but they have seldom been used in stochastic domains. We
formalize probabilistic landmarks and adapt the UCT algorithm to leverage them
as subgoals to decompose MDPs; core to the adaptation is balancing between
greedy landmark achievement and final goal achievement. Our results in
benchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the
performance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of
greedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent. The results
suggest that landmarks can provide helpful guidance for anytime algorithms
solving MDPs.

Abstract: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central
challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion
caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the
effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful
actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely
overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid
plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with
problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into
multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize
LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where
LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and
LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.
We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple
domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving
large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs
effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where
infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds
particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge
within LLMs.
