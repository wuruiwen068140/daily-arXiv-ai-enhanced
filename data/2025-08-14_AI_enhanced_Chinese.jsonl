In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach\noffers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on\nvalue estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining\nthe strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their\ndrawbacks.

However, SHAP values are usually treated as point\nestimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in\npredictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three\nreal-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight\ninto the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations.

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces\ncomputational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part\nof the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PFT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08SFDA\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u8868\u60c5\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SFDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec5\u542b\u5355\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u60c5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "PFT\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "PFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals.

We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key\ninnovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized\ngradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant\nversus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting\nmechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.\nSpecifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting\noperations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant\nconcordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS\npromotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion\nwhile preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation.

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and\ndiverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,\nsuch as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing\ngenerative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and\nanatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method.

We further\npropose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever\nwith a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based\non semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with\nsemantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet\nconsistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131\nLPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight\nretrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between\nacademic RefSR research and real-world applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08RASR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRASR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728RASR-Flickr30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRASRNet\u6bd4SISR\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53470.38 dB PSNR\u548c-0.0131 LPIPS\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic.

Recently, latent\ndiffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable\nresults. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail\npreservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic\ndatasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to\ncapture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization\ncapabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting\ninformation from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach\npreserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,\ngenerating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model\nR2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in\nthe foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.\nTo further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with\nMask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the\nforeground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background\nregions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random\nPoisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a\nsuitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and\nchallenging synthetic images.

Leveraging this\npipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from\nexisting open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with\nannotated facial angles.

Extensive experiments under three\nevaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration\ndatasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP\nimprovements over state-of-the-art methods.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkySplat\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408RPC\u6a21\u578b\u52303DGS\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0eRPC\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "SkySplat\u7ed3\u5408RPC\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CSCM\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "SkySplat\u5728DFC19\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aMAE\u4ece13.18\u7c73\u964d\u81f31.80\u7c73\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534786\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MVS3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SkySplat\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage.

We present\nWeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes\nweather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the\ntext context.

It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,\nand could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the\nscene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the\ndynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight\nand fuse visual features across modalities.

While recent\nadvancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,\nhead editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due\nto the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and\nglobal appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head\nAvatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the\ngeometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled\ntexture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two\ntypes of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance\nof head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture\nediting, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of\nnon-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence\nbetween 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping\nmethod, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp\ntexture images and real-time rendering speed.

While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections.

Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care.

Our approach\nintegrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that\npreserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial\nregions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination\nwith multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that\npreserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2\nmillion unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant\nimprovements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and\nlighting conditions.

Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and\nauditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory.

Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal\nformat, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.\nGiven an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative\nreasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the\ntask. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal\nagents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.\nM3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's\nperspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse\nscenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test\nkey capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,\ngeneral knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to\neffectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a\nregularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image\nrestoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants\nof ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,\nrespectively.

Quantitative analysis of the\nmicrostructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are\nimplemented to the entire 3D image.

After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,\nto tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we\nstrengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this\ninformation in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x\n16 x 16 discrete VAEs.

Without any\nadditional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is\nable to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and\ncolorization.

This\nhelps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and\nexpression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully\ntraining a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on\nextensive datasets.

Existing methods narrowly focus on subject\nidentity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial\ncomposition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we\nintroduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:\nLatent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across\npanels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual\nfeatures between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these\nmechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,\nenabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet\nconsistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf\nlanguage model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.\nTo evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain\nnarratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded\nstorytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene\nDiversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.\nOur qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that\nStory2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging\nstoryboards than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Story2Board\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u56fe\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8282\u594f\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Latent Panel Anchoring\u548cReciprocal Attention Value Mixing\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Rich Storyboard Benchmark\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u66f4\u5177\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Story2Board\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}
