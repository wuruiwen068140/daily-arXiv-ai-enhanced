### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的知识图谱补全（KGC）后验解释方法，通过多目标优化框架平衡解释的有效性和简洁性，并改进了评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGC的后验解释缺乏形式化和一致的评估，影响了可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出多目标优化框架统一现有后验解释算法，改进评估协议（如Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@k）。

Result: 通过统一方法和优化评估标准，提升了KGC解释的可重复性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为KGC解释性研究提供了更可重复和有意义的方向。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了数据准备度（DRAI）原则在领导级科学数据集中的应用，提出了一个针对高性能计算环境的二维准备度框架，用于指导AI训练的数据转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决科学数据在AI训练中的预处理挑战，特别是针对跨领域的标准化和可扩展性需求。

Method: 方法包括分析四个代表性领域的工作流程，并提出一个结合数据准备级别和处理阶段的两维框架。

Result: 结果是一个概念性的成熟度矩阵，用于评估科学数据的准备度，并指导基础设施开发。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架能够促进跨领域、可扩展且可复现的科学AI发展。

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例能在减少10%刻板印象的同时保留88%的推理准确性，为平衡MLLMs的公平性与能力提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力提升与偏见缓解之间的交互作用，解决两者是否必然存在权衡的开放性问题。

Method: 基准测试三种偏见缓解策略（SFT、KD、RL），并调整去偏见与推理样本比例以分析权衡关系。

Result: 强化学习训练的1:4混合比例在减少10%刻板印象的同时保留88%推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡多模态大语言模型的公平性与推理能力提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上表现糟糕，失败率超过93%，而人类成功率高达52%。研究提出了一个听觉图灵测试，揭示了AI在选择性注意力、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 设计了包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，涵盖七类任务，评估了包括GPT-4和Whisper在内的先进音频模型。

Result: AI模型平均准确率仅为6.9%，远低于人类的52%，尤其在选择性注意力和噪声鲁棒性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI架构缺乏人类听觉场景分析的基本机制，提出了整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法需求。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出并定义了‘论证一致性’属性，通过实验证明过滤不一致预测能提高人类和LLM预测的准确性，但用户实验显示用户通常不遵循这一属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证结构对预测的影响，提出‘论证一致性’以提升预测准确性。

Method: 定义‘论证一致性’属性，进行人类和LLM预测实验，并通过用户实验验证其效果。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高准确性，但用户普遍不遵循一致性。

Conclusion: 需在基于论证的预测中引入机制过滤不一致意见，以提升群体预测质量。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于Shapley值的责任度量（WSMS）在ontology-mediated查询回答中的计算复杂性，探讨了不同查询类和本体语言下的计算难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中事实的贡献是重要的，但现有方法在ontology-mediated查询中的复杂性尚不明确，需要深入研究。

Method: 利用数据库设置的结果，分析WSMS在不同查询类和本体语言下的数据复杂性和组合复杂性。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂性；而在某些本体语言下，问题变为shP-hard。此外，结构受限的查询类在DL-Lite方言中可高效计算。

Conclusion: WSMS的计算复杂性取决于查询类和本体语言，研究为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分治法的混合MILP方法，通过SAS评分选择关键ReLU变量，显著减少了二进制变量数量并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法在ReLU变量选择上效率不足，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 结合分治法，提出SAS评分和全局评分（GS），并采用混合MILP方法（α,β-CROWN和部分MILP）。

Result: SAS评分将二进制变量数量减少6倍，验证器效率提升40%，未解决实例降至8-15%。

Conclusion: SAS评分和混合MILP方法显著提升了验证器的效率和准确性，适用于大规模CNN。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is propelling automated
scientific discovery to the next level, with LLM-based Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Scientist systems now taking the lead in scientific research. Several
influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems,
with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025
workshop, suggesting that a human-level AI Scientist capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this
survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from
changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer
this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

Motivation: 探讨AI自主性的风险，尤其是超级智能可能带来的威胁，主张人类监督的必要性。

Method: 通过理论分析、12个论点、6个反驳及附录中的15个证据支持立场。

Result: 提出3级自主分类，强调人类监督对降低AI风险的关键作用。

Conclusion: 完全自主的AI风险过高，需确保人类监督以规避潜在威胁。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Result: LLM4Rail能生成准确响应，提供个性化餐饮推荐。

Conclusion: LLM4Rail通过LLM和QTAO框架有效提升铁路服务个性化水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-Foveate是一种创新的LLM驱动方法，通过多级注视技术提升指令合成的多样性和难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令合成方法依赖人工标注且多样性不足，Self-Foveate旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用“Micro-Scatter-Macro”多级注视方法，引导LLM从无监督文本中挖掘细粒度信息。

Result: 在多个无监督语料库和模型架构上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在因果发现任务中的表现，发现推理优先架构显著优于传统方法，并提出了一种模块化上下文管道以进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果推断是大型语言模型的基本挑战，研究旨在探索先进推理模型是否能稳健执行因果发现任务。

Method: 使用Corr2Cause基准测试OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型，并引入基于Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts的模块化上下文管道。

Result: 推理优先架构在因果发现任务中表现显著优于传统方法，模块化管道将性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 先进推理模型在因果发现中具有潜力，但需结构化上下文框架以最大化其能力，为跨领域因果发现提供通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

*David A Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果关系的解释方法，用于图像分类器的输出解释，具有形式化严谨性且适用于黑盒算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释方法缺乏形式化严谨性，而逻辑基础的解释方法虽严谨但计算假设过于严格。

Method: 提出因果解释方法，证明其形式化性质，并引入对比性因果解释和置信度感知的完整因果解释。

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性方面表现不同，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释方法兼具形式化严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DICE提出了一种动态上下文示例选择框架，通过因果分解和逐步选择准则提升LLM代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法对示例选择敏感，缺乏通用理论依据，影响代理性能。

Method: DICE通过因果分解示例知识，提出逐步选择准则，无需额外训练成本。

Result: 实验证明DICE在多样领域有效，提升代理的鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: DICE为LLM代理提供了通用、理论支持的示例选择方法。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

TL;DR: RAR是一种结合协作思想的探索机制，用于个性化问题推荐，提高训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索效率上表现不佳，难以找到最适合学生的问题。

Method: 提出Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR)，将协作思想融入探索机制。

Result: 实验表明RAR显著提升了推荐性能，且框架适用于任何基于强化学习的推荐器。

Conclusion: RAR通过高效探索机制，有效提升了个性化问题推荐的性能。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in
https://github.com/wuming29/RAR.git.

Result: TextQuests提供了一个专注于长上下文推理和自主问题解决的测试环境。

Conclusion: TextQuests为评估AI代理在复杂、探索性环境中的能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Conclusion: Seed-Prover展示了形式化验证与长链推理在自动数学推理中的有效性，推动了该领域的显著进展。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.
