Previous\ntheoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal\nsequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all\ncontinuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings\nof tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures\nfor LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as\nfunctions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have\nfocused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this\npaper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM\narchitectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,\nthese new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM\ncategories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential\nobjects, and subobject classifiers.

One weakness of MCTS is\nthat it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.

Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a\nnaive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to\nsimulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to\nresolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates\nBFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic\nand faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes\nreal-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world\ndegradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our\nmodel 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of\nauthenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in\nmodeling the real-world degradations.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLIPNET\u901a\u8fc7\u5207\u6362\u6062\u590d\u548c\u964d\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "FLIPNET\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u6062\u590d\u548c\u964d\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u964d\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFLIPNET\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u964d\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "FLIPNET\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system\nand perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition.

Although DETR-based methods have\nrecently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still\nsuffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit\nsemantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework\nthat incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through\ntransformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is\n\\textbf{ACTOR} (\\textbf{A}ction-aware \\textbf{C}ross-modal\n\\textbf{T}ransf\\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly\nattends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant\nfeatures. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages\nlanguage-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce\nsemantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level\nquery quality, we introduce a \\textbf{P}erceptual \\textbf{D}istilled\n\\textbf{Q}uery \\textbf{D}ecoder (\\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category\nawareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation.

Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating\nrealistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major\nchallenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches\nfrequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,\nmulti-dimensional evaluation frameworks.\n  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art\nopen-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by\nstructured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from\nexample-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and\ndomain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework\nfeatures a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated\ndata across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy\npreservation.\n  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,\nCirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt\nengineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with\nrule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance.

Moreover, they\nexperience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously\nlearn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder.

To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions.

As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

However, ultrasound deformable registration\nremains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently\nlow contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images\nseverely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.\nExisting methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical\ninterpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware\ndeformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages\nsynchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical\nprior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly\npredicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map\nutilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.\nThe stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense\ndeformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by\nHooke's law.

A total of 7,200 subjective\nopinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the\nvalue of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that\ndetect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.\nAmong these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)\nvideo quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of\nthe learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep\nneural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding\nprediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous\nstate-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,\nCBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video\ndebanding models.

Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE).

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results\nsuggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual\nlevel, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of\nhuman-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional\nAI.

However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring\nthe recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form\ndescription. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases.

To address these\nresearch gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic\nquestionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to\nmodel LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through\nthe empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic\nmarkers in comparable contexts.

The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm.

While\ntraditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from\nbi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for\naccurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change\ninformation by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question\nAnswering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have\nbeen developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share\nsimilar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world\napplications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is\nrevisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new\nmulti-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate\ndomain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space\nmodel, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed.

Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.
