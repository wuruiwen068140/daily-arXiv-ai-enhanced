For instance, a pasta dish might\nappear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting\nconditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the\nmost important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting\nin misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch\nFiltering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that\nshow greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF\ninvolves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less\nsimilar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With\npatch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a\nsimilarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and\nits respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate\nthat SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are\nmost prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a\nlimited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction\naccuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon\n\\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into\nfive treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1\nreal-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to\nimprove variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained\nusing a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and\ntransfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments\ndemonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the\nweighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying\nthat the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume\nof synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,\nthis validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately\nsubstitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to\nmaximize model performance for crop disease classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u897f\u74dc\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u75c5\u5bb3\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5b9e\u5730\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EfficientNetV2-L\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08H0-H4\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "H3\u548cH4\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u7684\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.65\u63d0\u5347\u81f31.00\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f5c\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications.

However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive\ncomputation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient\nreasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token\nbudgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and\nreliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify\nthat encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to\nits solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise\nreward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of\nintermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and\nnaturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and\nAIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++.

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels.

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations.

In this paper,\nwe introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured\nmathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math\n2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level\nhierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental\nprinciples. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and\ngenerate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a\nchallenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a\ntwo-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the\nmodel with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive\nAlignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to\nachieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with\ndiverse reasoning step distributions.

We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the\nfirst multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest\nX-Ray (CXR) reasoning.

PASS also continuously compresses salient\nfindings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding\nwhether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

However, existing\nmethods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results\nfor both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object\nDetection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The\narchitecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative\nTeacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality\nbranch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The\nteacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,\nsimultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative\ndesign enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to\nthe unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.\nTo further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label\nquality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)\nthat trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding\nthe learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model.

However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive\nendeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to\nits distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.\nConsequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning\nmodels for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological\nimages from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya\nHospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three\nsenior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the\nSTAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets.

Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage. Our method achieves \\textbf{1st place} in the competition,\nand experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance\nacross 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

This study\npresents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical\ntargets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of\nsimulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the\nclinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through\na novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid\nin catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft\nHoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated\ninsertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,\nwhere planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and\nreal-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is\nprovided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed\ntomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation\nof insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.\nSystem Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.\nTool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy\nmeasures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four\ndiverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,\nand animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application\nscenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,\nspanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and\ncounting.

To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a\nnovel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of\nhyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises\nover 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,\nstate-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,\nCogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary\narchitectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging\nsubsets enhanced with robustness evaluation.

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup.

Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,\nPractical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack\neffectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present\na tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack\ntransferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for\nhigh-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic\nScale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data\npreprocessing step.

Existing methods typically only model\nlow-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and\nenhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been\nwidely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited\nattention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance\nmulti-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates\nglobal and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order\nspatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:\nthe global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context\nenhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal\nenhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between\nadjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we\nfurther develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential\ncross-scale feature misalignment.

While autoregressive generative\nmodels are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,\nwhich contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent\nstudies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means\nclustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative\nmodels with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering\nperforms poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including\ntoken space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we\npropose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to\nk-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token\nsimilarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly\nused centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate\nfor the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.\nUsing an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space\ndisparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating\nlow-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play\nand integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms.

Current deepfake detection methods\nperform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to\ndatasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging\nand traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection\nmethods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly\nineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake\ndetection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative\nforgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided\nLearning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously\nadapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures\nthe differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,\nallowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To\nfurther improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual\nPerception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships\namong forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically\nperceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery\ntechniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then\nintegrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In\naddition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the\nentire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of\nforgery trace correlations.

However, generating videos that\nadhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications\nrequiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel\nframework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to\ntackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for\nphysically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across\nfour hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video\ncontent with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency\nusing boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories\nfor realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency\nbetween narrative and visuals.

We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an\nextension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and\ndatasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified\nframework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.\nAdditionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to\nenhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with\ndual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.\nExtensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms\nof generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified\ncross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.\nThe source codes and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/BradleyWang0416/Human-in-Context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u57df3D\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578bHiC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPose-in-Context (PiC)\u548cHuman-in-Context (HiC)\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5927-\u6700\u5c0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "HiC\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8ePiC\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HiC\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u57df3D\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent advances in\ngenerative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and\nanimation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present\nPuppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and\nanimation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal\nstructures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based\ntokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering\nmethodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning\ncapabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based\narchitecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly\nencodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,\nwe complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based\nanimation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being\ncomputationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations\nacross multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy\nand skinning quality.
