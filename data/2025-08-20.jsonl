While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization."}

To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,\nwe introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where\nLLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise\nconstitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially\nreduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a\nvision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual\nsimulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law\nand the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level\nevolution.

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency.

State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly\nrely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a\nnovel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for\nFR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility\nscore for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated\nwith the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via\nglobal self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information\nacross all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two\nheads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn\ndiscriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)\nthe quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face\nsample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several\nFR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that\nViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance.

This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images. Together, these\nresults reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities\nand human perception in identifying rotation."}
