### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了采样Kantorovich算子（SK算子）及其收敛性，分析了局部和全局逼近性质，并通过数值实验验证了不同算子在图像处理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同采样Kantorovich算子在图像处理中的适用性，验证其逼近性质。

Method: 引入多种算子（SK、高斯、双边、阈值小波），通过误差测量和数学参数（如MSE、SI等）分析其性能。

Result: 不同算子在图像处理中表现各异，某些算子对特定图像特征效果较好。

Conclusion: 算子的选择需根据图像特征决定，没有一种算子适用于所有情况。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的姿态动作识别框架，在隐私敏感的工业场景中显著提升了跨用户泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能制造环境中，实时准确识别工人动作对生产力和安全至关重要，但现有方法依赖集中式数据集，不适用于隐私敏感的工业场景。

Method: 使用自定义骨骼数据集和修改的FastPose模型，比较了四种训练范式（集中式、本地、联邦平均和联邦集成学习），并评估了LSTM和Transformer两种时序骨干网络。

Result: 联邦学习的Transformer在全局测试集上比集中式训练提升12.4个百分点，联邦集成学习提升16.3个百分点；在未见过的外部客户端上，联邦学习和联邦集成学习分别比集中式准确率高出52.6和58.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅保护隐私，还显著增强了跨用户泛化能力，是异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私感知的动作识别实用解决方案。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

### [3] [LENS: Learning to Segment Anything with Unified Reinforced Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14153)
*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过联合优化推理过程和分割任务，显著提升了文本提示图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时忽略了显式的思维链推理，限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力。

Method: LENS采用端到端的强化学习框架，结合句子、框和分割级别的奖励，优化推理过程和分割质量。

Result: 在RefCOCO等基准测试中，LENS的平均cIoU达到81.2%，优于GLaMM方法5.6%。

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理为文本提示分割提供了鲁棒的先验，推动了更通用的Segment Anything模型的发展。

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

Method: 基于通用视觉语言基础模型，结合区域编码器和掩码解码器，提出以自我为中心的视频数据生成流程。

Result: 在对象属性理解、分割和空间推理任务中达到最先进水平，并推出RynnEC-Bench评估基准。

Conclusion: RynnEC有望推动具身代理通用认知核心的发展，促进跨任务泛化。

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

### [5] [Local Scale Equivariance with Latent Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14187)
*Md Ashiqur Rahman,Chiao-An Yang,Michael N. Cheng,Lim Jun Hao,Jeremiah Jiang,Teck-Yian Lim,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度均衡规范化器（DEC）以解决计算机视觉中的尺度变化问题，提升模型的局部尺度等变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同一类别的物体可能因距离或自身特性而呈现不同尺度，这种局部尺度变化对模型性能构成挑战。

Method: DEC通过深度均衡规范化器改进模型的局部尺度等变性，可轻松集成到现有网络架构或预训练模型中。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，DEC显著提升了ViT、DeiT、Swin和BEiT等流行预训练模型的性能和局部尺度一致性。

Conclusion: DEC是一种有效且灵活的方法，能够显著提升模型对局部尺度变化的处理能力。

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

### [6] [CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197)
*Tinghan Yang,Md Ashiqur Rahman,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym利用CLIP的视觉-语言模型和旋转等变解码器，结合语义感知提示分组技术，显著提升了对称性检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性是计算机视觉中的基本几何线索，但检测对称性一直是挑战。研究利用CLIP模型的预训练能力，探索其在对称性检测中的应用。

Method: 提出CLIPSym方法，结合CLIP的图像和语言编码器，以及基于Transformer和$G$-卷积的旋转等变解码器，并开发了语义感知提示分组技术（SAPG）。

Result: 在三个标准对称性检测数据集（DENDI、SDRW和LDRS）上表现优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: CLIPSym通过CLIP预训练、等变解码器和SAPG技术，有效提升了对称性检测的性能。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at
https://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as
online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across
three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and
environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合图卷积网络（GCN）和Voronoi图的新型图像分类框架，显著提升了预处理时间和分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，而GCN能够更好地建模关系数据，因此研究探索了GCN与Voronoi图的结合。

Method: 通过将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域为顶点），并利用Delaunay三角剖分简化图，提出了一种名为NVGCN的新型GCN变体。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该方法在预处理时间和分类准确率上显著优于现有先进模型，尤其在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像分类提供了新思路，并拓展了图基学习范式在其他计算机视觉和非结构化数据领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

*Thanh-Dat Truong,Huu-Thien Tran,Tran Thai Son,Bhiksha Raj,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过解决视觉和文本特征对齐问题来提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）鲁棒性和泛化能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在视觉和文本特征对齐方面存在鲁棒性和泛化能力的局限性。

Method: 引入两种新任务（图像和文本顺序重建）到预训练和微调阶段，并提出定向标记方法和图像到响应引导损失。

Result: 在学术任务导向和指令跟随的LMM基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LMMs的推理能力、视觉理解和跨模态对齐性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

*Rizwan Ahamed,Annahita Amireskandari,Joel Palko,Carol Laxson,Binod Bhattarai,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）分级中保形预测器性能的影响，发现样本混合策略（如Mixup和CutMix）能提高预测准确性和不确定性估计的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在高风险任务（如DR分级）中需要可靠的性能，但缺乏鲁棒的不确定性量化限制了其临床实用性。保形预测（CP）提供了一种分布无关的框架，但数据增强策略对其性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估了ResNet-50和CoaT两种架构在五种数据增强策略下的表现，分析了保形预测指标（如覆盖率、预测集大小和正确效率）。

Result: 样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了更可靠和高效的不确定性估计；而CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 设计数据增强策略时需考虑下游不确定性量化，以构建真正可信的医学影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Result: 在牙齿添加、移除和全牙列合成等任务中表现出高保真度和泛化能力，FID分数低，SSIM值超过0.91。

Conclusion: 该方法为牙科AI工作流中的手术规划、患者沟通和数据增强提供了新机会。

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Result: 在真实数据集上展示了出色的开放词汇性能，同时减少了内存消耗。

Conclusion: GALA在2D和3D开放词汇查询中表现出色，为3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示条件，受限于CLIP文本编码器，且理由单一、噪声多，无法捕捉多样化的判别特征。

Method: 提出对比条件推理（CCI）框架，显式建模图像嵌入、类别标签和理由之间的概率关系，无需训练即可更有效地利用理由预测类别。

Result: 在多理由可解释物体识别基准上取得最优结果，包括零样本性能，并提升了分类准确性和理由质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为新基准提供了更完整的评估框架，推动了可解释物体识别领域的发展。

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在急性缺血性卒中（AIS）中，准确检测血管闭塞对血管内血栓切除术（EVT）至关重要，但DSA序列的解释因解剖复杂性和时间限制而具有挑战性。

Method: OccluNet整合了YOLOX和transformer的时空注意力机制，探索了纯时间注意力和分时空注意力两种变体。

Conclusion: OccluNet能够捕捉时间一致的特征，两种注意力变体性能相似，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实验表明，该方法能生成高保真、可控的多模态多视角视频，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在统一框架下实现了多模态多视角视频生成，提升了自动驾驶场景合成的能力。

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [17] [Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于类间关系的新损失函数（ICR），用于解决小物体检测中梯度更新不足的问题，并通过车牌检测案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based损失函数在小物体检测中梯度更新不足，导致学习效率低下。论文利用物体间的空间关系（如车牌与车的关联）来增强小物体的梯度更新。

Method: 提出了一种类间关系损失（ICR），通过惩罚预测框与关联物体（如车牌与车）的空间关系错误来引导学习。该方法无需额外超参数调整。

Result: 在SVMLP数据集上，ICR损失显著提升了检测性能，YOLOv12-T和UAV-DETR的mAP分别提高了10.3%和1.6%。

Conclusion: ICR损失通过利用类间空间关系有效提升了小物体检测性能，且易于集成到现有IoU-based损失中。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

SLR by providing computationally efficient methods that achieve significant
performance improvements across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 现有的Taxol效应检测方法需要专业设备、熟练人员和大量样本准备，成本高且不适合高通量或实时分析。深度学习在医学和生物图像分析中显示出潜力，但目前缺乏公开的Taxol暴露细胞反应数据集。

Method: 提出ResAttention-KNN模型，结合ResNet-50和卷积块注意力模块，使用k近邻分类器在嵌入空间中进行分类，以提高鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: 发布了一个新的显微镜图像数据集，并提出了一个基线模型，为未来研究提供了基准。

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型的公开发布将支持可重复性研究，并促进基于视觉的生物医学分析的发展。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

TL;DR: HRC-Pose是一种基于深度学习的类别级物体姿态估计方法，通过对比学习捕捉6D姿态的连续性，显著提升了预测一致性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖6D姿态作为监督信号，忽略了姿态的内在连续性，导致预测不一致和泛化能力不足。

Method: HRC-Pose通过对比学习学习点云表示，分离旋转和平移分量，并设计多任务、多类别的对比学习策略。

Result: 在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中，HRC-Pose优于现有深度学习方法，且实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过学习连续特征空间，展示了在真实场景中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Motivation: 解决情感可控说话人脸生成中的多模态关系建模和身份保持问题。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上实验，定性和定量结果均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在情感可控说话人脸生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪系统主要针对行人，对其他物体类别的泛化能力有限，因此需要一种更通用的跟踪方法。

Method: 结合遮挡感知重识别机制和道路结构感知轨迹优化策略，利用语义场景先验信息（如车道方向、人行道等）提升跟踪效果。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于通用多类跟踪，还在传统基准测试中表现优异，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Result: 在数据集上，TCFNet在评估指标和可视化结果上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TCFNet通过结合全局和局部特征，显著提升了面部骨骼点云变换的精度和效率，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Result: 在FPGA和ASIC实现中，QuadINR性能提升2.06dB PSNR，硬件资源减少97%，功耗降低6.14mW。

Conclusion: QuadINR在性能和硬件效率上均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by
up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为高效、准确的大规模ST预测提供了理论基础，推动了下一代稳健且分辨率感知的ST建模。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

Motivation: 工业异常检测对产品质量至关重要，但传统方法依赖大量标注数据且灵活性不足。基础模型的感知能力为这一任务提供了新机会。

Method: PB-IAD利用基础模型的多模态和推理能力，设计了提示模板和预处理模块，支持领域专家灵活定制系统。

Conclusion: PB-IAD通过用户中心设计和语义指令，显著提升了工业异常检测的适应性和性能，为动态生产环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux在英文文本输入下表现优秀，但对非英文提示（尤其是中文）处理不佳，现有方法无法充分解决文化特定语义问题。

Method: 利用MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT)直接控制Flux主干，减少参数量并增强中文语义理解。

Result: CTA-Flux显著提升了生成质量和文化真实性，同时保持与现有插件的兼容性。

Conclusion: CTA-Flux支持中英文提示，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义表达上表现优异。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Conclusion: UST-SSM通过时空建模和特征补偿，显著提升了点云视频的动作识别性能。

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is

array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌识别在交通执法和监控中至关重要，但低分辨率、运动模糊和眩光等问题导致识别困难，现有生成模型无法可靠恢复此类图像。

Method: 采用先进的光流估计器，结合时空一致性算法检测和纠正错误光流估计，构建了多帧恢复框架。

Result: 在RLPR数据集上，MF-LPR$^2$在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上显著优于其他模型，识别准确率达86.44%。

Conclusion: MF-LPR$^2$通过多帧对齐和优化算法有效提升了车牌识别性能，验证了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在2D到3D的姿态估计过程中存在深度模糊和遮挡问题，且可能忽略多尺度骨架特征，影响估计精度。

Method: HyperDiff结合扩散模型和HyperGCN，扩散模型处理数据不确定性，HyperGCN作为去噪器，通过多粒度结构建模关节间的高阶相关性。

Result: 实验表明，HyperDiff在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到最优性能，并能灵活平衡性能与效率。

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过创新方法有效解决了深度模糊和遮挡问题，提升了姿态估计的精度和适应性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法需要大量训练数据，限制了临床应用，因此提出了一种无需训练的方法。

Method: 使用冻结的DINOv3编码器，在测试时优化特征空间中的变形场。

Result: 在两个基准测试中表现优异，Abdomen MR-CT的DSC为0.790，HD95为4.9±5.0，SDLogJ为0.08±0.02；ACDC cardiac MRI的DSC为0.769，SDLogJ为0.11，HD95为4.8。

Conclusion: 在特征空间中操作提供了一种无需额外训练的临床配准解决方案。

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种基于频率的调节方法，通过扩散驱动的输入适应框架解决模型适应中的知识保留与领域适应平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型适应过程中因领域变化导致的任务相关知识遗忘问题。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，利用频率预测网络（Y-FPN）分离高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在15种损坏类型和3个数据集上实现语义分割和深度估计的SOTA性能，并缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: FOCUS不仅提升独立性能，还能通过伪标签增强现有模型适应方法，有效平衡知识保留与领域适应。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

TL;DR: TransLight框架实现了高保真、高自由度的光效迁移，通过生成解耦策略分离图像内容和光效，并利用百万级数据集训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光效编辑方法难以同时实现定制化光效控制和内容完整性保持，尤其在复杂光效迁移任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出生成解耦策略，使用两个微调扩散模型分离图像内容和光效，构建百万级数据集；采用IC-Light作为生成模型，注入参考光效作为条件信号。

Result: TransLight成功实现了跨图像的光效迁移，提供比现有技术更灵活的照明控制。

Conclusion: TransLight为照明和谐化和编辑研究开辟了新方向，首次实现了不同图像间的光效迁移。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在多主题合成与精确空间控制方面存在挑战，MUSE旨在同时满足空间精度和身份保持的双重要求。

Method: 采用串联交叉注意力（CCA）机制和渐进式两阶段训练策略，实现布局与文本指导的无缝集成。

Result: MUSE在零样本端到端生成中表现出卓越的空间准确性和身份一致性。

Conclusion: MUSE推动了可控图像合成的前沿，为多主题合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: NIRSplat为农业3D重建提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Conclusion: DAPA有效提升了对话参与度建模的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

Result: 实验表明，D^3-Talker在有限数据下实现了高保真渲染和准确的音频-唇部同步。

Conclusion: D^3-Talker通过解耦设计和精细模块，显著提升了3D说话头合成的性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Conclusion: DreamSwapV通过精细的条件融合和自适应掩码策略，实现了高效且高质量的主题替换，为定制化视频编辑提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen
environments. Check out our project webpage at

Conclusion: Vivid-VR通过创新训练策略和架构设计，显著提升了视频修复的质量和可控性。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

### [44] [SATURN: Autoregressive Image Generation Guided by Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14502)
*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATURN是一种轻量级扩展方法，通过将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，提升文本到图像模型在布局和对象关系上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂提示下难以准确捕捉布局和对象关系，而场景图提供了结构先验，但现有方法依赖复杂的GAN或扩散模型，速度和保真度不足。

Method: SATURN扩展VAR-CLIP，将场景图转换为token序列，仅微调VAR变换器，利用冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干网络。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，SATURN显著降低FID（56.45%到21.62%）并提高Inception Score（16.03到24.78），优于SG2IM和SGDiff。

Conclusion: SATURN成功结合结构感知与自回归模型的保真度，提升了对象数量和空间关系的准确性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

TL;DR: ScenGE框架通过生成多样化的安全关键场景，提升自动驾驶车辆的安全评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖预定义威胁模式或规则策略，难以暴露多样化和未预见的故障模式。

Method: 结合大语言模型生成对抗性场景，并通过复杂交通流放大威胁。

Result: ScenGE比现有方法平均多发现31.96%的严重碰撞案例，并能提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ScenGE生成的场景既可信又关键，有助于建立公众信任并确保安全部署。

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE是一种自适应全切片图像（WSI）编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域，显著降低编码时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像的高分辨率和大规模导致编码成本高昂，成为实际部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 利用病理领域视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过知识蒸馏机制计算低分辨率补丁与文本描述的相似性，选择性处理高分辨率补丁。

Result: WISE-FUSE将编码时间减少三倍以上，诊断性能与全面补丁处理相当或更优。

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE为计算病理学提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督方法，利用文档中字符形状的冗余性来纠正OCR系统的输出并改进聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OCR系统在处理低质量数据时表现不佳，尤其是打印文档中域内数据变异性低而域间变异性高的情况。

Method: 通过扩展高斯混合模型（GMM），结合期望最大化（EM）算法和簇内重新对齐过程及正态性统计测试。

Result: 在多种退化程度的文档上（如乌拉圭军事档案和17至20世纪欧洲报纸）展示了改进效果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了文档冗余性，提升了OCR系统在低质量数据上的表现。

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过残差向量量化（RVQ）增强姿势代码的方法，以捕捉细粒度运动细节，提升文本到运动的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于姿势代码的可控运动生成方法无法捕捉细粒度运动细节，限制了表达能力。

Method: 通过残差向量量化（RVQ）将连续运动特征与姿势代码结合，保留姿势代码的可解释性和可操作性。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，FID从0.041降至0.015，Top-1 R-Precision从0.508提升至0.510。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了运动生成的细节表达能力和可控性。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Motivation: 现有无标签概念瓶颈模型在定位概念时容易关注无关区域，需要改进。

Method: 提出LCBM框架，利用基础模型信息并通过原型学习确保概念的空间定位准确性。

Result: 实验表明LCBM能有效识别图像中的概念并提升定位能力。

Conclusion: LCBM在保持分类性能的同时，显著改善了概念定位的准确性。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOGS提出了一种基于2D高斯面元的两阶段框架，用于解决高光物体逆渲染中的模糊性问题，通过物理渲染和材料分解实现高效重建和逼真重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3D高斯Splatting）在高光反射下存在计算成本高、多视角不一致和材料属性模糊等问题，限制了逆渲染的效果。

Method: GOGS采用两阶段方法：1）通过基于物理的渲染和几何先验进行表面重建；2）利用蒙特卡洛重要性采样和可微分2D高斯光线追踪进行材料分解。

Result: 实验表明，GOGS在几何重建、材料分离和新光照下的逼真重光照方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOGS通过结合物理渲染和材料分解，有效解决了高光物体逆渲染中的模糊性问题，实现了高效且逼真的结果。

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）分析面临高分辨率和稀疏监督信号的挑战，传统增强方法效率低且语义控制不足。

Method: 提出HistAug，一种基于生成模型的方法，通过显式条件控制（如色调、腐蚀）在潜在空间生成增强嵌入，保留语义信息并高效处理大量图像块。

Result: 实验表明，HistAug在多种任务和器官数据上优于现有方法，尤其在低数据情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: HistAug通过可控的潜在空间增强显著提升了MIL模型的性能，为数字病理学提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为监控、工业安全和自主监测中的早期火灾检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Conclusion: 研究为推进基于提示的增量学习在目标检测中的应用提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，性能与ANN方法相当。

Conclusion: SMTrack推动了SNN在复杂场景中的鲁棒和准确跟踪。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce

TL;DR: GeMS是一个处理严重运动模糊图像的3D高斯溅射框架，直接从模糊输入重建场景，无需依赖清晰图像。GeMS-E进一步通过事件增强优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖清晰图像或COLMAP初始化，在极端模糊下不可靠。GeMS旨在直接从模糊输入重建场景。

Method: GeMS整合了VGGSfM（深度学习SfM）、3DGS-MCMC（概率分布初始化）和联合优化。GeMS-E加入EDI去模糊步骤。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: GeMS是首个直接从严重模糊输入处理极端运动模糊的3DGS框架。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联合知识迁移和保存的模型驱动方法，用于训练视觉基础模型（VFMs），避免了大规模标注数据的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型主要依赖数据驱动方法，需要大量高质量标注数据和计算资源，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 通过统一多个预训练教师模型在共享潜在空间中，并引入知识保存策略，利用适配器模块整合知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类、目标检测、语义和实例分割等任务上优于现有数据驱动模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建通用视觉基础模型提供了一种高效且资源友好的途径。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅在极端视角或部分缺失区域渲染质量不足，以及扩散模型在3D重建任务中缺乏场景信息的问题。

Method: 提出GSFix3D框架，通过GSFixer（定制微调的潜在扩散模型）结合网格和3D高斯，实现新视角修复和缺失区域填充。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中达到最优性能，仅需少量场景微调，且对姿态误差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D通过结合两种技术的优势，显著提升了渲染质量和重建准确性，适用于多种环境和重建方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Result: 在DAVIS'16、KITTI和Cityscapes上表现优于多尺度基线方法，且高效。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时、鲁棒的密集预测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于RAW图像光照和传感器映射的数据集和轻量级神经网络方法，以解决数据采集的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像的传感器和光照特性使得深度学习数据采集困难，需要针对不同传感器和光照条件进行场景捕捉。

Method: 使用定制光箱捕获多光照条件下的场景，构建包含390种光照、4台相机和18个场景的数据集，并提出轻量级神经网络方法。

Result: 提出的方法在光照和传感器映射任务上优于竞争方法，并在神经ISP训练中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该数据集和方法为RAW图像处理提供了有效工具，减轻了数据采集负担。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合单目RGB图像与AIS数据生成船舶6D姿态估计数据集的新方法，解决了AIS数据的局限性，并公开了BONK-pose数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖AIS数据的方法存在设备可靠性、数据操纵和传输延迟等问题，需要更可靠的船舶姿态估计方法。

Method: 结合YOLOX-X模型检测的单目RGB图像与AIS数据，生成3D边界框表示6D姿态，比较了PnP和单应性变换方法。

Result: PnP方法的投影误差显著低于单应性方法，YOLOX-X模型的mAP为0.80，并生成了BONK-pose数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注即可生成6D姿态估计数据集，BONK-pose数据集可用于训练和评估相关网络。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的方法，用于高速运动物体的6自由度姿态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速运动物体的姿态跟踪在机器人环境交互中至关重要，但传统相机因帧率限制和运动模糊难以实现。事件相机的高时间分辨率和低延迟可以弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 结合事件相机的光流算法和RGB相机的全局姿态估计器，实现高速运动物体的6自由度速度跟踪。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了算法的有效性，尤其在高速运动场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法成功利用了事件相机和RGB相机的优势，实现了高速运动物体的精确姿态跟踪。

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Motivation: 不同医院的病理图像因扫描硬件和预处理风格差异可能导致PFMs学习到医院特异性特征，影响临床部署的可靠性。

Method: 构建了量化领域偏差的流程，并提出了一种通过梯度反转层（GRL）连接的可训练适配器和领域分类器的对抗框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了领域可预测性，同时保持或提高了疾病分类性能，尤其在未见医院场景中。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了医院偏差，并通过医院检测和特征空间可视化验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

TL;DR: Tinker是一个无需逐场景微调的高保真3D编辑框架，支持单次和少量样本编辑，利用预训练扩散模型实现多视角一致性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术需要大量逐场景优化以确保多视角一致性或生成大量一致编辑输入，Tinker旨在通过预训练模型降低3D内容创作的障碍。

Method: Tinker包含两个新组件：(1) 参考多视角编辑器实现精确、跨视角一致的编辑；(2) 任意视角到视频合成器利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验完成高质量场景补全和新视角生成。

Result: Tinker在编辑、新视角合成和渲染增强任务上达到最先进性能，显著降低了通用3D内容创作的门槛。

Conclusion: Tinker是迈向真正可扩展、零样本3D编辑的关键一步。

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

Motivation: 解决视频流媒体快速增长带来的高精度和低训练成本挑战，同时挖掘视频和文本的细粒度信息。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，推理流程在MSR-VTT和DiDeMo数据集上分别提升Recall@1 2.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和推理流程显著提升了视频-文本检索性能，且无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在道路分割中存在延迟和计算量大的问题，事件相机提供了一种低功耗的替代方案，但缺乏标记数据。

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上，EventSSEG实现了最先进的性能，仅需少量标记事件。

Conclusion: EventSSEG充分利用事件相机的优势，解决了标记数据稀缺的问题，为道路分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

Conclusion: MS-CLR通过多骨架对比学习显著提升了骨架动作识别的表达能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Conclusion: 统一表示方法在可扩展物理建模中具有潜力，适用于机器人仿真和人机交互建模等下游任务。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

TL;DR: Virtual Community是一个开放世界平台，用于研究人类与机器人共存的社交智能，提供多智能体物理模拟器和真实世界对齐的社区生成管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与机器人在共享社区中共存的机会与挑战，研究社交智能的规模化表现。

Method: 开发了基于通用物理引擎的Virtual Community平台，支持多智能体交互和大规模社区生成。

Result: 提出了两个新挑战（社区规划挑战和社区机器人挑战），展示了开放世界任务规划和协作控制的难点。

Conclusion: Virtual Community有望推动开放世界中人类与机器人共存的进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

### [74] [Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14214)
*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在情感评估任务中与人类行为的对齐程度，发现GPT-4o在多数情感维度上与人类高度相似，但在唤醒度上差异较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在情感评估任务中的表现，以评估其在日常生活中的潜在应用价值。

Method: 通过让多个LLMs对已有人类情感评分的数据集（单词和图像）进行评分，比较其与人类评分的相似性。

Result: GPT-4o在多数情感维度上与人类评分高度一致（r ≥ 0.9），但在唤醒度上一致性较低；LLMs在五类情感框架中表现优于二维框架。

Conclusion: LLMs在情感评估任务中与人类存在相似性和差异，为理解其行为模式提供了基础。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

*Maria Leonor Pacheco,Fabio Somenzi,Dananjay Srinivas,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合决策过程和大型语言模型（LLMs）的神经符号方法，用于解释复杂决策序列，并以Hitori谜题为例展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hitori谜题的规则包含局部约束和连通性约束，前者适合用短解析证明解释，后者更适合视觉解释，因此成为测试SAT求解器和LLMs灵活组合的理想场景。

Method: 开发了一个工具，结合SAT求解器和LLMs，辅助人类解决Hitori谜题。

Result: 实验证明了该工具的有效性。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在解释复杂决策序列方面具有潜力，尤其是在结合符号推理和自然语言处理的场景中。

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的优化建模框架ORThought，通过系统化数据增强和新基准LogiOR，显著提升了复杂优化问题的自动化建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的优化建模方法存在高错误率、评估范围窄和计算效率低的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 通过数据增强和新基准LogiOR，结合链式推理框架ORThought，自动化优化建模过程。

Result: ORThought在复杂优化问题上表现优于现有方法，尤其是多智能体框架。

Conclusion: ORThought为基于LLM的优化建模提供了新思路，并分析了关键成功因素和失败模式。

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在网络环境中越来越像人类行为，带来了信任、责任、伦理等挑战，需要系统化的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了‘网络行为生命周期’模型和‘HABD’模型，从5个维度分析人类与代理的行为差异，并通过实际案例验证。

Result: 模型通过红队渗透和蓝队防御等案例验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为安全可信的人机协作提供了理论基础和技术路线，并探讨了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过结构化示例提升LLM代理在ReAct框架中的视角能力，但发现仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM系统在主动感知、协作推理和视角理解任务中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理流程，生成三类示例（G型、E型、L型），并将其转换为“思考-行动”示例。

Result: L型示例略微减少澄清请求和行动步骤，但未带来一致改进；代理在基础注意力过滤任务中成功，但在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角理解，需结合显式信念追踪、成本建模和更丰富的环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: LeanGeo是一个基于Lean 4定理证明器的统一形式化系统，用于形式化和解决竞赛级几何问题，并提供了几何定理库和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何求解系统缺乏统一框架，难以与其他数学领域集成，且几何证明依赖直观图表，验证困难。

Method: 引入LeanGeo系统，结合Lean 4定理证明器和Mathlib，提供几何定理库和LeanGeo-Bench基准测试。

Result: 评估了大型语言模型在几何推理上的能力与局限，开源了定理库和基准测试。

Conclusion: LeanGeo为几何问题提供了统一的形式化解决方案，但自动几何推理仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

TL;DR: H-J框架通过分层多智能体方法解决极端降雨事件中的应急调度问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端降雨事件频发导致城市洪水，现有方法无法有效协调感知、全局优化和多智能体协作。

Method: 提出H-J框架，结合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，形成闭环流程。

Result: 在真实数据上测试，H-J在交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: H-J展示了基于LLM的不确定性感知方法在城市洪水响应中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

TL;DR: MCP-Universe是首个针对大型语言模型（LLM）与真实MCP服务器交互的全面基准测试，覆盖6个核心领域，揭示了SOTA模型的性能局限性和挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简单，未能捕捉真实应用中的挑战，如长时推理和陌生工具空间。

Method: 通过6个核心领域的11个MCP服务器任务，结合执行式评估器（格式、静态、动态）进行测试。

Result: SOTA模型（如GPT-5、Grok-4、Claude-4.0-Sonnet）表现不佳，且面临长上下文和未知工具挑战。

Conclusion: 开源评估框架支持扩展，推动MCP生态创新。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PAC学习范式的数据驱动方法，用于确定CPS在有限时间步长内的安全概率，并通过主动学习范式验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS需要强大模型进行验证和诊断，但手动提取模型困难，数据驱动方法提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 基于Mealy机器的离散抽象，采用PAC学习范式，结合主动学习范式进行数据采样。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了方法的有效性，特别是在自动车道保持系统中的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为CPS的安全概率分析提供了数据驱动的解决方案，并增加了对概率的置信度。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI模型是否能内省，提出了一个更严格的“厚”定义，并通过实验证明LLMs在轻量级内省中表现良好，但在严格定义下未能真正内省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI模型的内省能力，解决内省定义不明确的问题，提出更可靠的内省标准。

Method: 提出“厚”内省定义，通过实验让LLMs推理其内部温度参数，验证其内省能力。

Result: LLMs在轻量级内省中表现良好，但在严格定义下未能真正内省。

Conclusion: AI模型的内省能力需要更严格的定义和评估标准，当前LLMs的内省能力有限。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.
