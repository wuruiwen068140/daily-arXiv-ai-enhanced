To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations.

The results indicate that operating in a\ncompact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general\nsolution for clinical registration without additional training."}

Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene\noptimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of\nconsistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent\nedits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing\npretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive\nresearch in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing\ndataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this\ndataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent\nedited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel\ncomponents: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven\nedits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video\nsynthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform\nhigh-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse\ninputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier\nto generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nediting, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that\nTinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.\nProject webpage: https://aim-uofa.github.io/Tinker"}

However, existing\nmethods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval\nperformance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the\nfine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained\nfeatures for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve\nperformance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine\nobjectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,\nincluding contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for\ntraining is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which\nis designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in\ncaptions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the\noriginal captions, referred to as \"Repetition\", can enhance retrieval\nperformance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this\ninsight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates\na voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better\nretrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental\nresults on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nprevious approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant\nperformance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT\ndataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset."}

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from\nreference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with\nhighly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight\nas the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate\nimages, delivering more customized illumination control than existing\ntechniques and charting new directions for research in illumination\nharmonization and editing."}

We measure pancreas\nsize and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals\nare to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas\nmeasurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect\npotential deviations in type 2 diabetes.\n  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged\nwith abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,\nsegmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological\npancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI\nmeasurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.\nSecond, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns\nstratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model\npancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2\ndiabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with\ntype 2 diabetes.\n  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13\nmorphological features were significantly different between patients with type\n2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons\ncorrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas\nmeasurements than CT using our AI-based method.\n  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape\nof the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and\n675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is\nsmaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan\npancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a\nclinical setting."}

We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive\nLearning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose\nrepresentations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same\nsequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture\ndiverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable\nfeatures. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons\nwith varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.\nExperiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR\nconsistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive\nlearning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,\nsetting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets."}

We introduce a unified representation\nthat jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This\nformulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports\narticulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior\napproaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.\nTo systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a\nnew benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each\nwith diverse part counts and motion configurations.
