The nature of these operators are demonstrated\nvia an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of\nsamples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the\nregion of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken\nslice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental\ntheorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations\nwe observe that the various operators have their own significance while\nstudying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an\nimage (non-ideal condition).

To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations.

However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position).

Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\napproach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and\nseveral public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose\nobject tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class\ntracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with\nHOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by\ntheir computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing\nstrategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods\nhave been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation\nbetween skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot\nprocess large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy\npoints, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on\nregistration.

However, the increasing\nresolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um\nor finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.\nConventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient\nand unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low\nexpression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and\nevaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel\nhistology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution\nST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net\nemploys a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene\nexpression maps in a parallelized manner.

To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a\nunified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to\nseamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through\nexplicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables\nbidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual\ndescriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive\ntwo-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable\nsub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial\naccuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the\nfrontier of controllable image synthesis.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness.

The proposed technique addresses the\nlimitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues\nlike equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By\ncombining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object\ndetection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D\nbounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and\nrotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to\nlocate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods\n(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image\ncoordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to\nhomography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold\nof 0.5 for relevant vessel classes.

We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,\nsegmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological\npancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI\nmeasurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.\nSecond, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns\nstratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model\npancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2\ndiabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with\ntype 2 diabetes.\n  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13\nmorphological features were significantly different between patients with type\n2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons\ncorrections).

We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Virtual Community\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u793e\u533a\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684Virtual Community\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u793e\u533a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff08\u793e\u533a\u89c4\u5212\u6311\u6218\u548c\u793e\u533a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6311\u6218\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u96be\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "Virtual Community\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
