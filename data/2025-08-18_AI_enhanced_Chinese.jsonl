Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most\nexisting approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support\npropositional rules.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic\ninteractive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:\n(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI\ntasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the\nagent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse\ntask-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a\nuniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these\nlimitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the\nvarying difficulty across trajectories.

HQ-OV3D\ncan serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also\nas a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary\ndetection or annotation pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "HQ-OV3D\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eDDIM\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c01\u95ed\u5f0f3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHQ-OV3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bIMCV\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548cACA\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7c7b\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0amAP\u63d0\u53477.37%\uff0c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HQ-OV3D\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Alerting to the presence of these objects is\ntherefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and\ntriggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a\nspecial kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and\nmachine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform\nappearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this\nproblem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,\na distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but\ngeometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with\nthis problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of\norientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an\nArtcode.

We also\nintroduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first\ntwo-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the\ncritical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the\nQwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's\naccuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025\nGenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I.

To manage the inherent\nhigh-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that\nintegrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information\nmaximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image\nquality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally\ninformative bands.

While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model.

For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency.

With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images.

Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from\nlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and\nquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,\nwhich aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and\nimage levels.

Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and\npatch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly\nallocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in\nlow-information regions.

In this\nwork, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video\ntokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy.

In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided\nProgressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human\npose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of\nthe IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.\nThe extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose\ndatasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the\nexisting state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the\nmore complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is\nmore significant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5173\u8282\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u5931\u6316\u6398\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528IGP-GCN\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO\u548cCrowdPose\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.

However, monocular\nendoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,\nincluding depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent\nendoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To\novercome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue\nreconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with\ntemporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework\nincorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust\ninitialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in\nconjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth\nestimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel\ncorrespondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on\nLPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from\nphysiological tissue deformation and motion.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise.

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories.

While supervised deep\nlearning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on\nextensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical\nworkflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often\nstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In\nthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot\nsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first\ntrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to\nproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically\nprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,\nwhich are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The\nproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice\ncoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that\nCoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated\nwith conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation\nresults.

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner.

In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs.

This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Thyme\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982O3\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThyme\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08SFT\u548cRL\uff09\u548cGRPO-ATS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd120\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cThyme\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Thyme\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u201c\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u7ef4\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
