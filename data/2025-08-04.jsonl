Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability\nframework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal\npredictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual\nelements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to\nboth open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level\nexplanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for\nindividual samples - \"why the model makes a specific prediction on this input\",\nand (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction\npatterns across samples - \"how the model integrates information across\nmodalities\". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP\nfaithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case\nstudies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond\ntwo modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal\nAI models."}

Direct\nLarge Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task,\nparticularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and\ndisease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage\nLLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with\ntiming) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes\ndisease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus;\nStage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific\nquestionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework\novercomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical\nknowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical\nexperts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,\ndiagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its\npractical potential to enhance patient information collection."}

To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a\nmulti-agent system.\n  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using\nAudio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,\nand audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing\nevaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies\ngood from broken or mismatched content.\n  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a\nbank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects\nrelevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify\nthe best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback\nfrom the AVR.\n  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content\nA against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly\nhigher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,\nmodels struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing\nno higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from\nhigh-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not\nseem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental\ndifferences between human and machine content creation approaches."}

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag\nassumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex\nsystems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time\nseries data.

The\nproposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing\nexplanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed\nversion for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users.

Unfortunately, malicious\nusers exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating\ndeepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is\npressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the\nmajority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and\nfake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family\nof generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative\nclasses and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of\nlarge pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.\nEffectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures\ninformation discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we\ndemonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve\nstate-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining\ncomputationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot\nsettings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,\nachieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline\nmethods."}
