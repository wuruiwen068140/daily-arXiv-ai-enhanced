While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOLO11-CR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u75b2\u52b3\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CAFM\u548cRCM\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a7e\u9a76\u75b2\u52b3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6216\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u867d\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faYOLO11-CR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542bCAFM\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u878d\u5408CNN\u4e0eTransformer\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u548cRCM\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u6355\u83b7\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728DSM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cYOLO11-CR\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u738787.17%\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u738783.86%\u3001mAP@50\u4e3a88.09%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "YOLO11-CR\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f7d\u75b2\u52b3\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving.

However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this\nprocess by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,\nenabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base\nattack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models\nacross CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents.

To\naddress this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement\nframework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables\nindividual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional\nexpression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four\nlightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent\nspaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space\nis characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define\nspecific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce\northogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate\nmotion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.\nThe learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared\nvisual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each\nspace, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head\nsynthesis.

The current MER methods in deep learning\nmainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image\nsequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'\nfine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This\npaper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical\nattention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D\nand 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN\nAMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network\nResnet18 and attention modules.

In this work, we identify a significant gap\nbetween LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they\noften answer \"Yes\" to queries like \"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\",\nthey will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or\neven directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To\nsystematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)\ntheir knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify\ncorresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to\navoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates).

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models.

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,\nneglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.\nRecent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:\n(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the\ndesired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and\nedges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges.

Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending\nto learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine\nhigh-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-\nand Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key\ninnovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit\nfrequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the\ntime-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is\nWavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet\ntransform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency\ninformation to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs\nin 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLAIR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RC-GAUSS\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548cWEGE\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709INRs\u7684\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709INRs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u5206\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "FLAIR\u5f15\u5165RC-GAUSS\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff09\u548cWEGE\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff09\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "FLAIR\u57282D\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u4ee5\u53ca3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709INRs\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAIR\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,\nwe employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence\nscores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial\nvalidation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on\nthree public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC\noutperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior\ndiagnostic performance.

Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has\nbecome an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG\nsystems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both\ntheoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical\nanalysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from\nthe perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have\nexplored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.\nWe carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and\nAgentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to\nsolve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating\nmultiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline\nlevel or the module level.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one.

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline\nmodel development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to\ndomain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory\nmanagement, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible\nworkflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \\textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular\nagentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling\nworkflows for financial applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose\nestimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables\naccurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth\ndata. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for\ncategory-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to\npredict and fuse the geometric features of the target object.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights\ninto SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our\nfinding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate\nperturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep\nevaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse\n(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are\ninefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can\nbe pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the\nCIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the\nrequired attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in\nwhite-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable\nattack success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTCA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86SNN\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TLBP\u548cA-MPR\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SNN\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "TCA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aTLBP\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\u548cA-MPR\uff08\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u91cd\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTCA\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8656.6%\u548c57.1%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TCA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528SNN\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images.

We\nintroduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept\nRepresentations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide\nmodels toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly\nimproves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective\neven in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy\nbinary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic\nspurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared\nto baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc\nconcept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic\nstrategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept\nsupervision.

State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly\nrely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a\nnovel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for\nFR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility\nscore for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated\nwith the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via\nglobal self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information\nacross all patches.

Project page: https://linjohnss.github.io/longsplat/", "summary": "LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from\ncasually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown\ncamera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose\ndrift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To\naddress these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian\nSplatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that\nconcurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and\nensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging\nlearned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that\nconverts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose\naccuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches.
