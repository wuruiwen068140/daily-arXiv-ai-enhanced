Recent advances in artificial intelligence\n(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved\nthe precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations\nof manual identification.

This structured\ntaxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting\nadvanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent\nwork and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern\nAI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in\nspeed and accuracy.

Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables.

In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an\nenhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the\nperformance."}

As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,\nthis knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without\nthe need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few\nlayers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost.

Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that\nthe existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are\nlimited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding\ndynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed\nLIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different\ncompression parameters using the AV1 video codec.

However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests.

Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that\noffers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more\naccountable LLMs."}

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm.

Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics.

A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees\nor graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework\nfor topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline\nthat enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised\nfine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both\naccuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,\nwhich reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,\nSTELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the\nlarger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it\noutperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and\nLLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%\nhigher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently\noutperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will\nbe available."}

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results\nsuggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual\nlevel, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of\nhuman-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional\nAI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of\nemotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions."}

As\ntheir commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA\nsystems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital\ninteractions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research\ncommunity needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,\nlimitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an\naverage success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA\n(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across\ndomains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We\nrelease our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open\nfoundations for further CUA research."}
